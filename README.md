# Hope Speech Detection: Identifying Positive Actors in Toxic Discourses 

This repository contains our course project for CSE 343 (Monsoon 2022).

### What is Hope Speech?

Hope speech is any message or content that is positive, encouraging, reassuring, inclusive and supportive that inspires and engenders optimism in the minds of people.

### TLDR for our project?

We match SOTA in Task 1 with simple ML Models while we beat SOTA in Task 2, and by a lot ;) using DL Models

### Directory Structure:

- [Data Preprocessing](https://github.com/aflah02/Hope_Speech_Detection/tree/main/Data%20Preprocessing): Contains the Preprocessing Files
- [Data](https://github.com/aflah02/Hope_Speech_Detection/tree/main/Data): Contains the Data
- [DataAugmentation](https://github.com/aflah02/Hope_Speech_Detection/tree/main/DataAugmentation): Contains Data Augmentation Utils
- [Word_Embeddings](https://github.com/aflah02/Hope_Speech_Detection/tree/main/Word_Embeddings): Contains the code to generate word embeddings and also the folder to store dump files. The word embeddings are hosted on Google Drive due to Space Constraints
- [Documents](https://github.com/aflah02/Hope_Speech_Detection/tree/main/Documents): Our Reports, Presentations and Proposal
- [Explainability](https://github.com/aflah02/Hope_Speech_Detection/tree/main/Explainability): Files to see evaluate models from an explainability lens
- [Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/aflah02/Hope_Speech_Detection/tree/main/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis): Our Visualizations and Analysis
- [Models](https://github.com/aflah02/Hope_Speech_Detection/tree/main/Models): Contains the code for our models and also the folder to store the saves. The saves for all our ML models are hosted on Google Drive due to space constraints while our DL Model checkpoints are too large to shift and hence are not present on Google Drive but you can generate them by simply running the notebook

### Our Top Models:
