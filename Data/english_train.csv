Is it really that difficult to understand? Black lives matter and all lives matter are not mutually exclusive. They are both true as general statements. So are white lives matter and asian lives matter. Black lives matter in this context is simply the name of a movement against the strangely high rate of police violence on black people and the statement is referring to those who behave like and treat black people as if they dont matter. For example;Non_hope_speech;

Sunshine littlephilly I can’t even imagine how your thought process works... Do you not have the capability to shape your own opinion. Especially on a topic that DOES in fact hurt homosexual people.

@Amazing Worenwu all lives means we are all equal;Hope_speech;
+Ancient Soul oh Lord. I don't think you'll ever understand. There's a specific context in which the black lives matter movement arose. Because black people were being killed and there were multiple incidents of the same type of thing. What exactly is the context for the all lives matter movement and focusing on the whole world? It was only created as a combatant otherwise it wouldn't even exist. No one is blaming white people. We're saying stop killing black people unjustly. That's it. Obviously there are other problems going. Probably more important ones too. But are people not allowed to stand up for themselves without being attacked? Would you not like to be able to stand up for yourself without being opposed? That's all this is about but sadly I don't think you'll be able to understand no matter which way I put it;Hope_speech;

@Jamie Ryan Storey i think Madonna holds a bigger grudge than Cyndi does on her.  Cyndi always speaks highly of Madonna and i find it odd (again) almost every interview with Cyndi .. Madonna is brought up in the conversation .. but with Madonna interviews; no mention of Cyndi.  One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.  But both are very creative and passionate about their work.  Definitely two worlds colliding.;Non_hope_speech;

It’s ashamed that you were met with ridicule after saying “All lives matter”.  I don’t agree with trashing someone who may not understand the cause. In short saying “ All lives matter” in response to “Black lives matter” can come off as dismissive and purposefully missing the point. BLM at its core is not meant to divide or ridicule but to bring awareness. Hopefully your conversations on the subject (should you continue to have one) end with more acceptance and understanding rather than anger and insults. Best of luck;Non_hope_speech;

All lives matter doesn’t make no logical sense because it’s white people who are suffering. BLM is like saying Black Lives matter too. It’s not saying Only Black Lives Matter. Too say all lives matter or white lives matter isn’t rational and of course you are gonna get booed. It’s because white people are being killed by the police for no reason. White people arent being discriminated against. White people got it made. Not all white people but the majority of America is white people. And not even 100 years ago my grandpa couldn’t use the same restrooms as white people. So saying all lives matter is like a chicken protesting against the wolf and the wolf saying their life matters too. Of course it does. But it’s not what the movement is about. So please shut up when you say all lives matter. No matter what you mean by it.;Non_hope_speech;

That's probably because they're still in the closet due to their christian brainwashing from their church. It happens a lot in Christian communities. Usually when they start to live outside that community then theh might just might come out. I grew up in a Christian community so I say this from seeing my LGBTQ friends come out not until their early 20s or even later. I love them all which is one of the many reasons why I am not Christian anymore. The churches thinking they have the right to judge. Check yourselves Christians read Romans 1;Hope_speech;

#BlackLivesMatter isnt about being better than other races its about making people aware of what black people go through that other groups don't. If white people where constantly being discriminated against they would actually have a reason to say whitelivesmatter. All lives matter makes people feel like it's is just there to downgrade what Blacklivesmatter really stands for.;Non_hope_speech;
@t0bias busterud You are missing my point. I find it impossible to understand that a movement that is trying to redress inequality has a main banner statement  of inequality. I am not putting the importance of any race over any other. The statement White Lives Matter is just as wrong as Black Lives Matter. I am sure the movement has some valid points but the cause is not helped by a provocative banner. All Lives Matter would be perfect for the movement because it wouldn't diminish the impact and it would show absolute unity and equal opportunity for everyone going forward. I believe this would garner additional support from all areas of all communities.;Hope_speech;
Kudos to Wired for not trying to stifle and censor discussion although I had to check to see if I accidentally clicked on a Buzzfeed link.

@SepherStar Well I would partly disagree. Even train drivers in the US are known as engineers as apart from driving train engines they are expected to know the nitty gritties of their engines as well as troubleshoot engine problems when in operation. What I meant by working with hands (exaggeration) was that skilled engineers are more hands-on with practical experience on shop floor or on site in case of projects. This is precisely why women are misfits in a field like engineering cuz they are dependent mostly on technicians and do not like to take orders from their managers (submissive attitude) due to ego problems. (Managers would rarely shout orders to female sub-ordinates lest they get sued for sexual harassment... so instead of giving orders to their female sub-ordinates;Non_hope_speech;

Being against someone who is LGBT is basically being against people’s existence and everyone has the right to live their lives as they see fit.

The elephant in the room just needs to be mentioned. When we say Black Lives Matter a lot of people don’t understand what it really means so they call it racist.  I Know people that are white and Hispanic that held up the sign during the George Floyd protest. The reason why they did this was not  because they wanted to be black But  because they knew what it meant . In short it means that we matter  to but we feel like people that aren’t our color in general don’t recognize that we do. We know all lives matter everybody should know that. God loves us all but we don’t love us all.;Non_hope_speech;

@Mr. carpenter bee maybe I should have used the word indoctrinate not brainwashed. nobody forces an adolescent to believe in a religion but they are more prone to believing certain views if they grew up with that religion being the norm. But if they leave that community and are able to think outside that norm then they might question several aspects but when someone is under a certain age they just go with the flow of their communities norms unless it causes them pain. There have been many LGBTQ youth in religious communities who are shunned when they come out. Just think of the implications and pressures someone has to go through when their community does not accept them. in my opinion;Non_hope_speech;

@Luke B Ah did not know about Pride wanting to have no police company outside of their participants. Still that should have nothing to do with option for Pride to call police for help.nnStill sounds silly.

Not for them to prance around doing nothing but looking good.nThat is different business called Modelling.;Non_hope_speech;

I just want to point out that the Bible does not say that homosexuality is a sin. The passage that I’ve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. “Men shall not lay with man” was originally meant to read as “man shall not lay with boy”. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship.

With it I had the option to put what I want in my houses/structures. It was much more fun to be able to create something.nnI also loved drawing and started it young but then I thought my drawings were different than my classmates' and I was too shy for anything so I had to match my drawings to the theirs because I was too scared to be bullied again... I was bullied sometimes. I was scared to be good at what I do because I would grab attention if did.nIt just made me put away my interests as if these were not a big deal and I grew up thinking I do not deserve to shine and beyter just be in the shadows and live a passive life.nI regret it.;Hope_speech;

Isn't the majority of killings of Black lives in America actually by other black individuals?   I highly value Black lives I have traveled to Nigeria twice and to Rwanda twice to teach workshops on how to save newborn babies at birth.  These babies happen to be Black and I have worked in hospitals to save people of all races.   My understanding is there are a whole lot more black lives lost though in the United States due to Violence among the Afro American community in impoverished neighborhoods.   To focus on the police as a critical solution to the loss of Black lives and to take actions that are not precisely calibrated will result in a great increase in the loss of Black lives.   The police have been serving the Black community.   Yes there have been incidences of abuse by police just as there have been nurses that purposefully killed their patients but we don't decide to get rid of nurses because of these few  crazy ones.   After all Black lives matter right?;Non_hope_speech;

She hasn’t matured and hasn’t been able to experience enough to formulate her own opinions yet. She may have beliefs based on how her parents raised her. Doesn’t mean she’s homophobic;Hope_speech;

@WOW Thank you for that helpful comparison.  The problem inherent in this situation arises when the BLM movement embodies radical principles that threaten the lives of other groups or lawful systems.r  The movement's dynamic shifts from peacefully calling attention to the oppression of the black race to radically lashing out with violence or hate speech under a logic process that can be summed up as two wrongs make us right.

@stick Lonnie Stevens No! Black lives are the most oppressed ones. White's are the least. The problem is black lives are oppressed and that's what BLM is trying to solve. Don't be mad because ur race isn't included in this. You shouldn't want it to be! You should be grateful that u don't need one that's why I don't support alm movement.

To me that means - why don't white people care enough to march for their own killed by police. It's not about how loud black people are - it's about how quiet white people are. If you find injustice scream about it. You think doing this kind of thing is easy! Coward maybe?;Non_hope_speech;

@Elijah Yisrael Funny that you say that.  Looking at Dimitar's name looks like they're not even from the U.S.  If this person migrated to the U.S. then they probably have LESS rights and LESS privilege than a typical black American.

POLICE LIVES MATTER. I BELIEVE THE COP IN FERGUSON WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF.

Daiyan Farrel Keigo Hartono BLM are protesting across Europe and the UK...it’s not just the USA these protests are occurring.   One of my points is for the BLM spokespersons to look at the big picture and give a voice to modern day slaves who are currently bought and sold from within the African continent.  Asian people are employed under false pretences of employment and forced into the sex trade or slave labour.  So rather than wasting all that energy looting and ripping statues down why don’t BLM focus and protest on something that’s happening right now.  Pulling a statue down achieves nothing!;Non_hope_speech;

@NOXISUM you really couldn't have been more racist with that comment. I'm African American and I support the all lives matter statement. You sit there and say white people make it about them. Uhhh no it's not just white people its every other non black race and they're not trying to bash this protest. But why can't it just be about police brutality and racism in general. Black people and white people get hated on all the time and that goes the same for Asians and Hispanics. The all lives matter thing is saying police brutality needs to end and so does racism. And do you really think black people aren't racist against white people. I just saw a video of a group of black people beating the sh!t out of white people and setting their cars on fire. Like what kinda response is that. It seems like you think only black people know struggle racially or otherwise and that's just not true.;Hope_speech;

For people who were judging Annie (and I read that she has come out now but I'm not sure if that's true) I was the same way when I was younger because I grew up in a religious family. But I was really really confused and hated myself because I couldn't understand why God would hate me if I like girls. Which for me made me try to prove even more that I didn't like girls at all. I finally left the religion two years ago and came out as bisexual. It's really scary if your family is homophobic and tell you that you are damned forever for that...;Hope_speech;

@Dirieh Ngongo Black lives mattered since the civil rights act was passed in 1964. Everyone knows black lives matter in the modern day and age. But you cannot shy away from the fact that there are and always will be individual racists by constructing a movement that is completely counterproductive to the African American community. Blaming it on factors such as systematic racism that clearly doesn't exist for black people. Let's take college acceptance for example. A black candidate for being a student in the school premise is more sawn after than a person of yellow colour with the same qualifications. Now tell me how you guys have it worse that isn't of your own doing. By creating this victim mentality you literally take all hope away from them with the lies you radicals have created.;Non_hope_speech;
BLM is indeed an organization who has their own beliefs and stand for different things. But BLM is a statement or phrase that stands for the fact that black lives matter too.

Some of the black lives matter people are doing things correctly to protect their people but there are some that are destructive against innocent people and bad people too.When someone says black lives matter it is rude to say all lives matter because the purpose of this movement is black protection for their people and it’s rude to bring other lives to erase its main purpose.Its like saying “My cousin died help me”then person two replying who cares mine died too.Respecting personal rights means world peace .;Hope_speech;

They care about the money also. The leaders are getting big bucks to create all this chaos. The rest are either crack heads or bored rich and semi rich kids looking for action.  Also maybe to get back at mommy and daddy for some trinket or such that the kid wanted. When they didn't get it they joined the BLM movement. Same as those celebs from Holkyweird cause it's the newest thing to spend their money on so they can feel good about helping some poor kids starving. nThey don't realize the devil has a grip on their souls.

Hai Huynh I do do research and that does happen. I feel like you’re only looking at black people who are getting killed and dismissing the other races that are also getting killing in the same way. Have you seen the videos about random bricks being left in the middle of protests? Or how there are triangle holes being left in glass windows where riots and looters happen. There’s under cover stuff going on. Blm is pretty much like a cover up for an agenda to take place. It’s making people have hate in their hearts and causing destruction. That movement isn’t helping anything at all but only making the left come up with up ways to continue salving people who are black.;Non_hope_speech;

God did NOT create the human races;Non_hope_speech;
Very reasonable and well thought out. I agree and further more can add that a number such as the ratio of men to women in engineering fields does not show there is a problem. Rather this demonstrates that despite a  level playing field women as a whole don't want to be or may dream about it but are not willing to put in the work as frequently as men are. I was listening to a consultant for law firms talk about female lawyers and the legal field has a hard time hanging on to female partners after 30 years old. This iss not based on their skills because they will have earned their place;Non_hope_speech;

I've started engineering projects this year and they have been well received by all (boys and girls).nnIn reply to the comment about men not being in elementary Ed. I don't see men as not being encouraged to be teachers. There is no culture saying men aren't smart enough to be teachers. However it seems girls may think they are not smart enough. A lot of it is misconceptions about what engineers are and do.nnIn response to the victim comment. She is being an example for young girls that even if you are told you can't do something you should try again and not give up.

Jeff Davis statistically white people are born in a better economic situation than most black ppl. We also have a higher median income than the black community in every class. Black ppl also have a much lower chance of being accepted for a traditional mortgage.

I hope this changes ur view.;Non_hope_speech;

I didn't even know I liked programming until I took an intro cs course during my senior year of high school. nI always knew I had kind of an engineering mentality growing up because I liked taking scraps from the recycling bin and building random things from it. I even made houses for my dolls and ignored the store bought doll house my parents gave to me for my birthday.nThis really inspires and reassures me that I'm making the right choices for my path.

Y’all really need to let go. Yes we know all lives matter. That’s a given. But the reason why people have to say black lives matter “too” is because black lives have it mattered since the 1800s!!! We know like white lives matter that has been proven that white lives matter over all of her lives in America time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again. Nobody has ever questioned if all lives matter. So that part of the conversation is over with and irrelevant. Now let’s concentrate on the lives that have not mattered in America. Please concentrate and focus on what needs to be done to help. Don’t concentrate on what needs to be done to perpetuate the current paradigm. It is time for a change. All lies has always mattered and white lives has mattered above all in black lives has mattered the least in America. Stay focused people..;Hope_speech;

I'm sorry to say this but I don't think that she can do very much in order to inspire girls to become engineers with her product as it still heavily relies on the parents buying them. I believe that the real issue isn't getting girls interested in engineering but rather to prevent parents from pushing their kids into stereotypical roles because I think that the families that buy Miss Sterling's books are the same that would have also gotten their girls a variety of toys;Hope_speech;

Btw don't apologize for offending anyone. Not saying whatever you want and holding back leads to suppression of speech which eventually leads to tyranny in short. Not many people know about why America was born . Yes they were slave owners but tell me one person in this country whos ancestors weren't owned from 3000 or more years ago till now. We all have been slaves. We are all still slaves to the monetary system really.

From listening to them speak about their experiences I feel like most of them are externalising internal fears and prejudices they feel should exist and hold themselves back rather than there being some pervasive and rampant problem. Fewer women than men comprise the workforce but what is the percentage of women that study these fields and what is the percentage of women that actively search for a job in those fields?nnThis is a fairly emotional study of a few women that seem to have grown up with a belief that a bias existed and still does. This isn't a level headed representation of the industry today and leads to nothing but personal speculation. Completely pointless.;Non_hope_speech;

@Hai Huynh  One thing that is left out and never clarified is the behavior of the person who is being sought by the police. Why is it a justification for that person to run or get away from the cops or do other things that will escalate the matter? You think it's OK to do things like that to the police? Does this give them cause to disobey and we should just let them off free just because they're black and their lives matter?  It's thoughts like these that have criminals getting out of jail and running free to continue doing crimes because dumb people think it's OK. Then when these criminals go out and hurt others;Non_hope_speech;

She did repeat the statement I do not fit in multiple times but that was for effect. It is called repetition for effect. But what she was trying to say was that she did not fit in because she was in a room full of OTHER MEN. That's the whole point of this TED Talk. She's not blaming on the lack of skills to become an engineer but rather pointing out a flaw in the societal view on gender norms here in the United States and the impact this has on kids and their decisions in the future.

I'm so inspired to inspire young females to dare to challenge societal pressures and expectations and open the minds of the close minded.

@Mikey Inman so sad right. The rabit whole is so deep but people just get mad n dont even look up anything. Its just brainwashing. It breaks my heart because all this stuff the musicians do is all to hurt  others because they are loyal to the elites. But they are fully mk-ultra and totured themselves. Noone should go through that. Its horrible torture that u can barely break out of. Except for a few like britney spears kanye west ect. But they either get sacrificed or programed right back to make money from. The fbi even admits to the monarch programing mk ultra. They torture children and adults. I would never want to b in hollywood at all. People regrey so much after they sign that blood contract but they only basically get out through death cuz theyre too much of a risk to tell the truth. Many are telling the sick truth but even then they often r brushef off. Just research its right there.;Non_hope_speech;

I think its racist to say black lives(or any skin tone) matters more then the others and if a white person said white lives matter of course that would sound insanly racist but to define and put into seperate groups >lives< by any skin tone black or white is racist in its self and you tell'em david clarke...also that juan williams is a nut case damn liberals.Bernie so failed that test in the debate as well cause he was trying to be politically correct lol;Non_hope_speech;

Wow another good TED speech but what I find shocking are some of the comments. You would think that by 2014 we wouldn't even be having these debates.n2014 and we are still B***t ing and moaning about gender roles.nnThe only weakness for females would be physical. They might struggle doing manual labor such as using a jack-hammer but mentally the are equal to males. Its just the way kids are programed. Most parents don't even do it intentionally but each gender is programed to do certain things so by the time they grow up they are on auto pilot. They can't tell you why they like doing this or that because they were program to do certain jobs while they were young. That's why each gender tend to do certain job.nnIts takes guts to say NO!

@Jamie Ryan Storey i think Madonna holds a bigger grudge than Cyndi does on her.  Cyndi always speaks highly of Madonna and i find it odd (again) almost every interview with Cyndi .. Madonna is brought up in the conversation .. but with Madonna interviews; no mention of Cyndi.  One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.  But both are very creative and passionate about their work.  Definitely two worlds colliding.;Non_hope_speech;

YuhakushoWeebtard but black lives matter has a cause. Black people are being shot and killed by cops and it’s wrong.

We are missing the best female talent. There may be females that are truly interested but not encouraged (as in told about engineering not forced) or bullied out of it (there have been studies that show capable females leave STEM because they are bullied by peers or faculty). I do not force anyone into a field they are not interested in - I have a cousin that would be capable but not interested. I tell her to do what she likes. But there are females that would like it - we need to find them. A diverse workforce makes it a better workforce. Crash tests were only conducted using males dummies until females engineers got involved and saw there needed to be tests on females as well! Females and males do approach problems in different ways;Hope_speech;

Black panthers and last poets were anti-gay. So was Malcolm X. nBlack Lives Matter movement is against the nuclear family and they are pro-marxist as they admit this on their website. This isn't a black movement... it's an LGBTQ movement for gays & pro-welfare state agenda disguised as a black movement. nnBLM remained quiet during the shootings on fathers day where over 100 black on black killings took place. The reason they didn't address it is because they didn't want to bring focus to fathers day as it would go against their beliefs.;Non_hope_speech;

Saying All lives matter can be offensive for the same reason black lives matter can be offensive to some. Black Lives Matter is an offensive saying because to some  it insinuates that the majority of non blacks think that black lives don't matter and that the majority of non blacks are racist when there is absolutely no physical evidence to support that thought. So obviously to a non racist non black that is a grossly offensive notion. Now All Lives Matter can be offensive to some blacks because to them it insinuates that they only care about black lives and that they're saying other lives don't matter when if you actually try comprehend their perspective;Hope_speech;

People say Black lives Matter becasue it is obvious that many Americans think they don't matter.  The slogan does not day Only Black lives mattter.  Saying all lives matter is a way to avoid saying that Black lives matter.  It has been adopted by racists around the country.  400 years of history (which many refuse to acknowledge) prove that black lives do not matter to many Americans.;Non_hope_speech;
You see the reason for the saying black lives matter is too raise awareness of how many black people are victims of oppression. A better way to put it is Black Lives Matters Too. So when people say all lives matter it is a true statement but contradicts Black Lives Matter.;Non_hope_speech;

BLM no longer wants body cameras on police.  Watch a few bodycam police videos and you’ll understand why.

They basically stood by and did nothing. They were worried about public safety and just writing them up even more than they already were. We’ve all seen how these idiots have been acting right now.

Lorenna Kocijancic well spoken . In 1964 I went to live with my grandparents and my grandfather was the Chief of police in our town and held that position for 22 years for a total of 33 years as a cop.

Ik I thought she would get emotional because they would be able to relate.... but then again sometimes it takes a long time to come to terms with the “weird” feelings you feel so she may be repressing them... there’s a lot of discomfort on her face throughout the video and honestly I think she fears someone is going to “drag her out of the closet”. Growing up I dealt with that same kind of fear not because my family wouldn’t accept me because I knew they would but I was scared I wouldn’t accept me... idek if that made sense but overall she could just be fighting this internal battle that her true self hasn’t fully won yet;Hope_speech;

There's nothing therapeutic in being hurt or brainwashed. How do we still call those... things therapies ? This is nothing more than legal abuse.

Just letting y’all know god never said he dosent agree with homosexuality. If your going to the Bible it’s says “a man who shall lay with a woman shall no do with a man” but that part is mistranslated. Man was actually Boy which is referring to pedos. Also you gotta kinda remember the Bible was not written by god it was written by men who claimed to have met god. I’m not going against religion I’m just saying the truth if you still don’t believe in it that’s fine because it’s your opinion but I’m just throwing all this out there;Non_hope_speech;

So is your face! That's why you don't have a profile picture.;Non_hope_speech;
My opinion...Black LIves Matter is both a phrase as well as a political organization founded by three community activists with a socialist agenda. When you say black lives matter you may believe you are simply supporting a slogan but you are also empowering the leftest organization of that name. According to White House records the organizers were coordinating and meeting with the Obama Administration in the aftermath of Ferguson as the group was being founded and are closely aligned with the Democratic Party. It is clever strategy to use what sounds like a well meaning slogan as the name for a political organization with a much larger agenda.;Non_hope_speech;

I think it's very hurtful that it's like saying we don't think black lives matter.  Someone in another country does an atrosity and we end up with people crowding our local town scaring people and spreading the virus and potentially killing people by doing so.  It's like pent up lock down syndrome... . Please think of other ways to show us your views. I am white and might not get exactly what you mean or misunderstand. How about having an mp who just does black rights  in the uk.  The NHS etc have enough to do right now with riaki g there lives against the virs...

Jens “it seems racist”....you have many people just in this comment section alone claiming it is racist. Whether you agree with them or not there are people offended by it. Now you’re telling me it’s deliberate and designed to be provocative to get people talking...you can’t see the hypocrisy here? nI get they want to be heard and feel like they haven’t been treated as equals but the message should always be equality. It should always be about bringing everyone together and making them realise we are all the same regardless of skin colour. Nobody should be made to feel racially attacked or victimised in a movement to stop that very thing happening. n“So why should they pander to white comfort and preach a slogan that keeps white people in that comfort space” again it’s comments like this that implies all white people are the problem here which simply isn’t true. You can’t fight racism while attacking an entire group of people based on their skin colour;Non_hope_speech;

Ill be honest this speech did not inspire me. She made it seem like they don't encourage women to do well in engineering. As a Chemical Engineering student I have been nothing but supported by teachers and other classmates in my program to succeed and do well. The STEM field wants more women in the field... women just don't choose to be in the field. The majority of women want to be in other careers like teaching or business. Most of the girls that I have talked to ask me why I would want to be into a major like this. It's not a problem of women not being encouraged to be in engineering;Hope_speech;

Just love everyone who isnt anyone.;Non_hope_speech;

There was no All lives matter movement before the Black lives matter movement. Saying all lives matter exists with the sole function of being a counter argument or distraction to civil rights issues. Obviously the police and a large percentage of white people do not actually believe that all lives matter. All lives matter quite specifically exists and ONLY exists to oppose the statement that black people matter. How is this hard to comprehend? Do the doctors refuse you  care when you're injured because all patients matter?;Non_hope_speech;

I agree;Non_hope_speech;
I think we should collectively agree to not label this as therapy. This is not therapeutic at all. This is abuse. Covering it up with a medical term when its not even medical in nature  (hitting someone with a book is physical abuse/repeating verses meant to break your will for hours a day is mental abuse) is disrespectful to the field of medicine which serves to help and cure people. Gayness does not to be cured. It is not a disease. It is not a choice. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Now lets respect one another and help stop this abuse.;Hope_speech;

@mya kahlo hahaha your whole argument fell apart. You can't hold BLM accountable for what some protesters say in the heat of a protest. The Dallas shootings were an isolated incident. The BLM does not condone violence nor does it hate police officers. nice to see you've admitted you're against it when you've been dismissing it the whole time. Also your profile picture and linked google account shows you're a white male so I have trouble believing anything you say at all. Nice to see you also like to victim blame and that basically black people should just deal with racism because the world is not out to get them when it so blatantly is. Colorblind racism at its finest.nnKeep liking your own comments though. It probably makes you feel better.;Non_hope_speech;

Tenacious Tacosnthere tends to be this antagonism towards women stating their point of view because it is automatically viewed as misandrist and discriminatory against men when paradigms like sexism and racism are not symmetrical because of the historical precedents where one group has been favored more than another.

No you’re missing the point. When a black life is taking there is no consequence to the police. When a white man takes a white man’s life the life matters when a black man takes a black male life the wife matters when an agent man takes an Asian man life the life matters. But when you have cops killing black people regularly on camera and getting away with it. You tend to believe black lives don’t matter. Because if it was white people in those situations it would never have had happened. So then you have to ask yourself do black lives matter to the American government and the judicial system. The answer is no! Do all lives matter yes of course that’s been established. Now let’s talk about the lies that are being taken by the people who are supposed to protect us. Stop avoiding the point. I can’t even believe they talking about in all lives matter debate versus a black lives matter debate. The day you see all lies being treated the way black people has been treated then we will have it all lives matter debate.;Non_hope_speech;

@DragyTD People are reaching. Not once did anyone say 'ONLY black people lives matter' but when you're talking about stuff like 'Save the Turtles' people don't automatically assume that those that say it are saying that we should save ONLY turtles. People just don't want black people to have things to themselves. All the time we are expected to share our stuff. So people can stop lying about 'it implies that only black lives matter'. When SE Asians were being discriminated against in the UK and America not ONCE did someone say ALM and not once did people mention the struggles that people of other races go through UNTIL people said BLM. They didn't care before;Non_hope_speech;

There are only two sexes (and also intersex people so technically three sexes) but gender identity is up to the person.

It's not about black lives.

As someone who dosnt really feel comfortable saying “I’m religious” but would say my beliefs fall most closely to Christianity and attends church regularly... this whole concept of conversation therapy disgusts me. I have read the Bible through and through. Yes the Bible does say that homosexual actions are sinful. It also says a thousand other things are sinful (things we are all guilty off in our lifetime) the Bible clearly says all sin is forgivable. The Bible says the greatest commandment is love. Jesus when faced with the option to condemn chose love over and over and over again. He forgave and he showed compassion. In fact the only people Jesus was super blunt or “mean” with. Was not the drunkerds;Hope_speech;

@Forest Gump in 200 years time if it turns out that society finds the practice of making computers abhorrent for reasons that we don't understand today should we tear down statues of tech company executives who donated large sums of money to charity. Do people like Bill and Melinda Gates become cannon fodder to history? No we appreciate their kind work in the standards of their time. Honestly put some donation boxes on the statue and donate the funds to a slavery museum like the one in Liverpool. History is done.

MrCosmin94 and your statement “opening” people’s minds is completely invalid when you yourself have no prior knowledge to a actual topic. And making a point as bland as “who created god “ is like asking which universe created the universe. Because from a naturalistic view there has to be a natural non divine explanation. And based on the Laws of thermodynamics energy can’t just appear and disappear but be constant. So when you take nothing and create an infinite expanding universe with finite energy that is always constant and never created or taken away you come to question how that energy got there in the first place? It is the reasonable human reaction. So to tell people who have found peace in an answer for themselves makes you someone that can’t stand others happiness or comfortability.

It's wrong but that's what they think. End of argument. Can we now focus on all the traitors to this country? Like the governor of Seattle letting an autonomous community spring up in front of his eyes? Or the victimhood mentality that is damaging MOST youth?

I find the statement BLACK lives matter Offensive and RACIST towards me as It should have said ALL lives matter. The FACT you have to bring up MLK from over 50 yrs ago shows you still live in the past. I have always taken people at face value regardless of their skin colour but to try and rewrite history by pulling monuments down and wanting to get rid of things like the confederate flag and ban tv shows and movies is going to the extreme in my opinion.

Why exactly police allowed them to block them?

The level  of ignorance Michael brown attack a police officer and try to get his gun!!!!;Non_hope_speech;
Mmmm. I would disagree. Religion is belief if you believe something hard enough it stops becoming a choice. People in soviet Russia were brainwashed to make them love Stalin. They couldn’t make an active choice to deny it because that’s the way they perceived the world around them. It’s like seeing a green apple and trying to convince yourself it’s not green. It’s almost impossible because that’s how you see it. If a religious person sees homosexuality as wrong and believe it enough it becomes less of a choice and more of  a perception of the environment around them.;Non_hope_speech;
So at this time. And for a long time. Black and brown are abused and murdered at a high rate. So it’s nothing wrong with accentuated and pointing out the obvious.  What about statistics ?;Non_hope_speech;

@***** The movement began in reaction to the deluge of unarmed black victims of police (and wanna-be police) violence in the news recently.

All lives matter and frankly from what I've seen is that gun laws in America are yet again the true problem whether out of prejudice towards the colour of skin I think it's ludicrous the chances between the rich and poor are divided and that is where the true issue is it is difficult to get rid on one bigoted billionaire that so happens to be the president of the United States but laws around the world have no difficulties ridding poor people out of the society so therefore I'm afraid that the majority is playing a dangerous game of racial anger that can result in a civil war that would not be beneficial for whatever colour of skin you've put your bets on so when I say all lives matter I mean to say;Hope_speech;

And I get that he was a criminal but we don’t need to focus on that because that doesn’t mean he had to die when his death had nothing to do with what happened 5 years ago.

@Jason Devon Unfortunately the traditional definitions of right and left in politics have been completely distorted by the leftist 'woke' agenda. By traditional standards I would consider my political views to be slightly left of centre - for instance I'm in favour of universal healthcare and a compassionate welfare state.

Because it’s totally unrealistic. It will take generations to even come close to stopping racism and discrimination.

That shit happens everyday dumbass. You just don't hear about it. OBVIOUSLY;Non_hope_speech;
@Molly Rebekah Girl I'm Christian too and you are waaaaaaaaaaaaay outta line. What I'm taught from the bible and what I see it saying is that we should love all. Do you believe that God loves each and every one of us cause that's what we are taught as Christians that he loves everyone of us. So the fact you think God doesn't like LGBTQ people is misinformed because God loves all of us not just some of us ALL of us.nnIt's people like you that give us Christians a bad name because you want to make your own version of life where God only likes what you think and that's what you tell people. When in fact God loves all of us and wants us to love eachother like we want to be loved.  So before you come here claiming to be Christian go and rethink everything you think and read up on what God teaches us. nnnLike girl bye.;Hope_speech;

If you think that black lives matter means only black lives matter you've shown your own ignorance this movement of black lives matter is a cry out saying black lives matter also... It is sick that a cop would shoot an unarmed or non lethally armed black man. Whites get killed by the cops but 9 times out of ten they were in the wrong the problem is the gross misconduct of excessive jail time and innocent black lives in jail. That's what these people started the black lives matter movement and it's media who have the responsibility to convey the grievances of the people yet you leave us wanting... There are bad protesters and there are bad cops but untill police brotherhood is disbarred and cops work like Walmart employees where they see someone in the wrong they stop it instead of covering it up we're gonna sit here and stew in the wreckage of our ignorance.;Non_hope_speech;

Zach Jerde no. Not ‘end of discussion’ calling someone an ‘it’ is the most de-humanising thing you could possibly do and that’s disgusting that you think that’s okay. An ‘it’ is what you call an inanimate object or an unidentifiable creature not a human being.;Non_hope_speech;
You don't get it do you. Black Lives Matter does not mean white lives don't. It just means Black lives are being treated unfairly by the police and this needs to stop. If there's a burning house you would try to save it and not say no but All Houses Matter... Your house isn't burning... Black people needs the BLM movement to get equality. Stop thinking about just yourself and imagine if you're black. You can get killed by just going for a jog;Non_hope_speech;

Did they really have to say Black lives ALSO matter?'  or Black lives matter AS WELL?' in order for you people to know what they were saying? Come on!

It is totally destructive. The poor are being kept poor black or white. It is the poor that has more interaction with the police and are more susceptible abuse by the police.

I want you to know that I watched this video when I was ten years old right when it came out. I have never been more grateful for a video. Since I watched this I have changed my entire trajectory. All of my goals and everything I spend my time on is to become an engineer. I am now a Junior in high school and I have been on a robotics team for 5 years. I spend my time teaching other people about engineering and doing outreach events to inspire young kids to go into STEM. I am in a Pre-Engineering program. I created a STEAM event to teach kids how art and STEM are related. I have done all of this because of this single video. All the time and energy that I have put in I did because of this video. Thank you so much you gave me a passion I didn't know I had and it has changed my entire life. I know you won't see this but I feel in debt to you and I needed to thank you.;Hope_speech;

You are ignorant. People don't say white lives don't matter when they say black lives matter. White lives have always mattered and valued more than black lives. To ignore the disproportionate targeting of black people is bizarre. Or maybe you think this society is a happy accident where black people are lesser beings and they made their bed. Saying black lives matter does not mean white lives don't. Saying all lives matter invalidate people that recognize that black people are subjected to racism. If you think black people are subjected to violence the same as whites you are seeing things from a bias that enjoys having power over others.;Non_hope_speech;

Lilyx Yeah well did you also know black man actually have a better chance of getting their life taken by another black man than a white police officer;Non_hope_speech;
There has never been a question of all lives matter. The fundamental issue is black lives matter the same. This country has never questioned the value of white lives. It has historically undermined the lives of black and brown lives. The movement is questioning systematic racism and trying to bring the country to a balance state by addressing black lives and making our lives matter as well. There is not a black person that doesn't understand all lives matter;Non_hope_speech;

I could maybe be sympathetic if they were less vague. All I hear is them ascribing sinister motives to people who seem like they are just being overly friendly nerds.nAnd these testimonials right before the statstics on women engineers in Silicon Valley seem to imply that the reason that there are less women in tech there is because it is a hostile environment for women. But step in your typical engineering classroom in America and then tell me that there are as many women interested in engineering as men. A gender inbalance   does not automatically mean discrimination;Hope_speech;
