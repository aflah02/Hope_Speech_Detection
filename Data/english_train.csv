these tiktoks radiate gay chaotic energy and i love it,1
@Champions Again He got killed for using false money,1
It's not that all lives don't matter,1
Is it really that difficult to understand? Black lives matter and all lives matter are not mutually exclusive. They are both true as general statements. So are white lives matter and asian lives matter. Black lives matter in this context is simply the name of a movement against the strangely high rate of police violence on black people and the statement is referring to those who behave like and treat black people as if they dont matter. For example,1
Whenever we say black isn't that racists?  Why don't just say Americans.,1
Ros The Boss u don’t know that she’s actually lgbtq tho so....,1
That was funny at the end when Larry said 'What are we arguing about then'. haha but that said,1

Funny thing is,1
I'm still hiding my gender to my parents and they don't know I'm dating someone. My friends knows already about my gender and they are very supportive of it. And I'm very thankful to find true friends like them,0
all lives matter .without that we never have peace so to me forever all lives matter.,0
Clark thank you. I salute you.,1
@J Brown It makes it seem like my opinion doesn't matter when someone gets attacked for holding a All Lives Matter sign.,1
Yall talking lesbian but I think it more likely that's she'll come out as trans,1
France France I think you’re the one being dumb.  It’s actually very simple. Did you not know all lives include black lives? If you have a basic understanding of the English language you should understand that.,1
@Fa1con i love how people like you read a comment that goes against your agenda and spat instantly zero evidence when all you need to do is type we are trained marxists blm and boom there you go,1
Randomgirlwhosings0804 Why does she feel the need to have to agree or not agree with someone’s sexuality? Why does any Christian? it’s really weird. there is nothing for you to “agree” with,0
the people who would normally be saying whu are all the disney princesses setting unrealistic standards for young girls are now saying that having a fat guy who happens to have darkish skin is racest... the rock is the voice actor for the character and he seems to be fine with it. Next lets say big hero six is racest because it is slightly japanese and hero is fat sometimes. its not like mr incredible who is white and sorta chubby got this kinda shit.,1

Its a political move by the democratic socialist party...MAGA!!!! The media is telling and showing you what the dems want them to...except Fox News...good job!!!,1
Sunshine littlephilly I can’t even imagine how your thought process works... Do you not have the capability to shape your own opinion. Especially on a topic that DOES in fact hurt homosexual people. Whether you believe they should be harmed or not has nothing to do with it. When you publicly state a person is wrong for just living their life,1
But Sadism isnt evil is it? Unless you're sadistic to unwilling participants. Alot whats considered evil now a days depends actually more or less on your perspectiv of what happens. If i were to hit a dog,1

jazzfan1 When I read your comment it sounds kind of dumb and racist. You act like only white people are slaying only black people daily.,1
I beg they just put it straight back up,1
Agreed! It is straight up abuse in all three formats,1
So did I. She’s clearly grooming herself and behaving in a more masculine manner. Lol when she said she didn’t agree I was like “...you don’t?”,1

Now let's mention the Black names that fell Victims in the hands of protesters.  The Black Owners protecting their businesses. Who's gonna protest for them? BLM only care when a white cop is involved but turn the blind eye when they are the ones responsible. FACTS!,1

I don't see what the big fuss is.  Just add the modifier also to your slogan.  Black Lives Also Matter.  If that's not your intent,1
Could've got some good scrap metal money out of that,1
ALL LIVES MATTER and to say they don’t is REAL RACISM.,1
Exactly. They're not fighting for equality,1
Juan Williams should be ejected into space..,1

It's gone full circle like an Ouroboros for these SJWs.,1
That SHERIFF for President !!!!!,1
I just wasted 7 min watching people discuss which lives matter and how to say it. It’s just a distraction from the reality that anti black racism is not common place in America. Why should I take anyone who can’t see past that seriously,1
He’ll yes. Whoop Whoop,1
Should have broken and destroyed the statue before throwing it down the river,1
So pulling a statue out is going to re-write the past is it? Mindless fools. It would be different if there still was slavery in Bristol. But the present has moved on from the past and these moronic individuals need to also.,1
Democrats horring for votes!!!! That is the truth right in your face!!!!!,1
I have never understood homophobes like it’s just hatred not justified by an old book that you worship and interpret literally it’s gross,1

Do you know how many times in history these descriptions have happened?  Do you think this is worse than the holocaust?  The Bible gives guidance that we won't know the day and hour but the end will come like a thief in the night.  Don't quote scripture to predict when you think the world will end.  Just ask Hal Lindsey.   People have been predicting the end with scripture for the last 2000 years.,1

What do the amarican people mis in their heads that when an important problem like black lives matter is spoken about they change it into all lives matter and than they do not realise how big of an insult that is for the black people and their problems of the last 300 years.

ALL lives mattering was NEVER A QUESTION......that is why it is annoying. Black communities feel that their lives don't matter that is why it was created. so responding with black lives with all lives matter is implying that you don't stand with the black community.,1

@Amazing Worenwu all lives means we are all equal,0
+Ancient Soul oh Lord. I don't think you'll ever understand. There's a specific context in which the black lives matter movement arose. Because black people were being killed and there were multiple incidents of the same type of thing. What exactly is the context for the all lives matter movement and focusing on the whole world? It was only created as a combatant otherwise it wouldn't even exist. No one is blaming white people. We're saying stop killing black people unjustly. That's it. Obviously there are other problems going. Probably more important ones too. But are people not allowed to stand up for themselves without being attacked? Would you not like to be able to stand up for yourself without being opposed? That's all this is about but sadly I don't think you'll be able to understand no matter which way I put it,0

@Teehee hi First off,1
@Jamie Ryan Storey i think Madonna holds a bigger grudge than Cyndi does on her.  Cyndi always speaks highly of Madonna and i find it odd (again) almost every interview with Cyndi .. Madonna is brought up in the conversation .. but with Madonna interviews; no mention of Cyndi.  One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.  But both are very creative and passionate about their work.  Definitely two worlds colliding.,1
I also thought that  but in the end,1

It’s ashamed that you were met with ridicule after saying “All lives matter”.  I don’t agree with trashing someone who may not understand the cause. In short saying “ All lives matter” in response to “Black lives matter” can come off as dismissive and purposefully missing the point. BLM at its core is not meant to divide or ridicule but to bring awareness. Hopefully your conversations on the subject (should you continue to have one) end with more acceptance and understanding rather than anger and insults. Best of luck,1

peter gunn yeah if you wanna come I am always ready to take you around,1
All lives matter doesn’t make no logical sense because it’s white people who are suffering. BLM is like saying Black Lives matter too. It’s not saying Only Black Lives Matter. Too say all lives matter or white lives matter isn’t rational and of course you are gonna get booed. It’s because white people are being killed by the police for no reason. White people arent being discriminated against. White people got it made. Not all white people but the majority of America is white people. And not even 100 years ago my grandpa couldn’t use the same restrooms as white people. So saying all lives matter is like a chicken protesting against the wolf and the wolf saying their life matters too. Of course it does. But it’s not what the movement is about. So please shut up when you say all lives matter. No matter what you mean by it.,1
Truth hurts. BLM just can't handle the Truth!,1

That's probably because they're still in the closet due to their christian brainwashing from their church. It happens a lot in Christian communities. Usually when they start to live outside that community then theh might just might come out. I grew up in a Christian community so I say this from seeing my LGBTQ friends come out not until their early 20s or even later. I love them all which is one of the many reasons why I am not Christian anymore. The churches thinking they have the right to judge. Check yourselves Christians read Romans 1,0

MrCosmin94 You’re kidding right? Making such an assumption with no knowledge whatsoever? You do realize there is outside historical record that Jesus actually did exist all biblical and religious statements aside. I find it funny how you obviously have no clue what you’re talking about and yet have your mind so made up? Interesting. This discussion is clearly pointless and invalid now cause you have no true statement that stands with any credibility. Did you also know that the original historic claims from the Bible,1

#BlackLivesMatter isnt about being better than other races its about making people aware of what black people go through that other groups don't. If white people where constantly being discriminated against they would actually have a reason to say whitelivesmatter. All lives matter makes people feel like it's is just there to downgrade what Blacklivesmatter really stands for.,1
@t0bias busterud You are missing my point. I find it impossible to understand that a movement that is trying to redress inequality has a main banner statement  of inequality. I am not putting the importance of any race over any other. The statement White Lives Matter is just as wrong as Black Lives Matter. I am sure the movement has some valid points but the cause is not helped by a provocative banner. All Lives Matter would be perfect for the movement because it wouldn't diminish the impact and it would show absolute unity and equal opportunity for everyone going forward. I believe this would garner additional support from all areas of all communities.,0
Kudos to Wired for not trying to stifle and censor discussion although I had to check to see if I accidentally clicked on a Buzzfeed link.

Fox News is literally the worst news source I have ever seen. I am writing an essay about the phrase “All lives matter” for my English 105 class.

@SepherStar Well I would partly disagree. Even train drivers in the US are known as engineers as apart from driving train engines they are expected to know the nitty gritties of their engines as well as troubleshoot engine problems when in operation. What I meant by working with hands (exaggeration) was that skilled engineers are more hands-on with practical experience on shop floor or on site in case of projects. This is precisely why women are misfits in a field like engineering cuz they are dependent mostly on technicians and do not like to take orders from their managers (submissive attitude) due to ego problems. (Managers would rarely shout orders to female sub-ordinates lest they get sued for sexual harassment... so instead of giving orders to their female sub-ordinates,1

they only say that's what they're fighting for to get away with it; to get away with being racist. They are ACTUALLY fighting for Black Supremacy,1

Kleo here I’ll give you an example. Alm is like you throwing a funeral for you child and then me coming in and beginning to talk and brag about my child and demanding my child get attention. Because all children matter my child should also be talked about. Actually,1
Being black in the industry,1
began with rumors of war then a pandemic now riots this is the most interesting year so far,1
@Jimmy The Clown You implied it in your statement. I don't understand why you even bother commenting under a video about Madonna supporting LGBTQ when you don't even like her.,1
@I Like Feeling Electric b** please!,1
White People murdered by cops doesn’t get publicity.  We don’t celebrate our criminals.  We leave that to the families.,1

Of course it's matters that all of the people have access to  apples,1

I feel like the whole world is suppose to feel sorry black people like y’all are the only race on planet earth. Give me a break.,1
Because is not depicted to ethnic groups.And all lives matter would mean there’s some white people in the mix. And we are the problem. We  are supposedly the ones who have privileged. And we don’t get harassed or troubled by police. We have everything more than black person. Looks like to me I see 3 black men who look successful to me . What are you complaining about again,1
Why ? Slave traders should not be celebrated.,1
Yes like the blacks who sold their black neighbours to  europeans for the slave trade.,1

Stop making the world racist and stop hurting institutions.,1
I was so confused for a second there cos I thought this was a recent segment and Larry was shitting all over the current presidency. I thought he’d switched sides haha,1
@Hey McFly All of that regards George Floyd is completely irrelevant. Nobody should be killed by police for suspicion of using fake money. An independent autopsy found that he died from asphyxiation from sustained pressure. Use your mind and stop making excuses for police brutality!,1
@Vera a not really. That's what the left wing media wants you to think. 99% percent of everyone is America don't know what true oppression is.,1

Not ONE snippet of smashed windows or burning buildings,1
SoldierT nobody else like this comment. It's at the perfect number of likes.,1
@River Rower how?  She actually revolutionized music.  So I don't get why you are here?  If you don't like her than fine.  We all have a right to our own opinion.  But I just don't get people who watch interviews with celebrities on the net when it is clear they don't like them?  Why watch someone if you really don't want to?  I mean no one is forcing you to watch this.🤔,1
The full saying is Black lives matter,1
I agree with the old lady,1
Change what? What needs to be changed? These women are complaining about the same things us men deal with on a daily basis. It's just them talking about their insecurities and complaining about nothing at all.,1
@Jessica Walker mistranslated btw x,1
this was awesome.,1
@emmett Yeah and that's why you're a disgrace to LGBTIQ community,1
Go back to Africa,1
@2000tc88 A white woman was murdered a few years ago but i did not see it. If you could give me tge story that would be great. But do all lives matter really. I can tell you are an articulate dude but how can all lives matter when one is being constantly attacked and we have to literally prtest for you to hear us? Yes MLK was 50 years ago but that just adds to the point. 50 years down that line and we still fighting that uphill struggle. Maybe you wont understand it and i dont expect you to,1
@Red Lady its not just music dude. Its her being vocal on the things that could ruin a career back then,1
If you disagree to all lives matter...your racist,1
These protests have gone too far,1

@Jimmy The Clown I don't agree with everything about Madonna (but I too am a sinner) but let me ask you something...who turned all the men into sinners?It goes both ways.,1
They didn't give in.. they lied to BLM to get them to stand up and keep marching,1

@Molly Rebekah  I dont need a book to understand morality. nYour love is fake. nYou came onto a video for a guy that had been through TRAUMATIC conversation therapy. nAnd you're planning to tell people like him they're wrong in the eyes of god and its sinful and immoral. nYou my love have a  sly tounge trying to use gods love ( which if you read through the bible hes actually incredibly evil ) to hide your hatred. nStay away from my LGBTQ brothers and sisters.,1

The interviewer is bit too adulatory,1
Asking for equality is trying to get votes?,1
The countless portrayals in books,1
The way i see is that these statements Black/All lives matter is not the crux of our argument. Rather our problem is how we PERCEIVE/UNDERSTANDING of these statements.,1
This is a great interviewer. She is really calm here which is good but  I hope she is getting enough rest too,1
All lives matter is only comprehensive to BLM.,1
On a scale of SJW to These kids how woke are you,1

@Africa conscientious Partially but not complete - there was a moral crusade,1
@Beatrix Dantly There is no truth. Only propaganda you are selling.,1
The home secretary can condemn a slave traders statue being torn down but can't stop the migrants allowed easy passage through the English channel.,1
Why is that such a mood,1
Time to rebuild the statue in bronze and reinforce its base so anti white mobs cannot destroy the BRITISH peoples homeland.,1
and also the bible was badly translated so actually there is nothing against gays in it and also nTREAT YOUR NEIGBORS LIKE YOU WANT THEM TL TREAT YOU,0

@TheLegend27 Is Alive Do you have to spend so much time attacking other people on some random video,1
Eventually you have to realize 10 people in a row might rub you the wrong way and the 11th won't... This is why you can't hold a whole skincolor responsible for what you aren't comfortable with ...

@Rose Throop the narrative that the slogan all Lives matter is associated with is the issue.,1
All live matter - saying Black Lives Matter ignores the flight of American Indians & Hispanics who also suffer.,1

Democrats need moderate votes to win. Republicans can easily claim more electoral votes due to their influence In sparse rural areas. Republican candidates can win simple by pandering to their base.,1
Both candidates should avoid using triangles as well,1
BECAUSE THEY ARE RACISTS !,1
Those who claim Jesus supports homosexuality are mislead. Jesus loved the homosexuals enough to tell them that their sin will take them to hell if they dont stop and repent.,1
@Molly Rebekah  You are just as bad as everyone else yeah not everyone believes in God I don't either and you may think you are doing good but you are actually causing harm do you think LGBT people choose to be LGBT no bc if it was a choice no one person would choose to be discriminated against and beaten up and killed for who they love conversion therapy is awful and shouldn't even be a thing and I get it you are religious but the Bible never really mentioned homosexuality you just took that one part and said oh this must mean homosexuality when it could mean many things and let's not forget to Bible has been translated so many times from the original version we don't really know what it says and I don't wanna hear anything about the your religion,0

Amazing Atheist 4 president!,1
All Lives Matter is a high jacking/stealing of black protest and another way to ignore black Americans. It's like this- when a child in a family is stricken with leukemia,1

Raven Williams say all lives matter is more inclusive to all injustice killing of people no matter there skin colour. Saying all lives matter does not say that black lives don’t. But then again people call it to say it’s okay to be white is racist wrong,1

I thought the title was “kids meet a conversion therapy specialist” and I was like W.T.F,1
The Marxist International have hijacked the protests because BLM is Marxist in it’s ideology. That’s why is being seized upon in countries like the UK that have low levels of police misconduct like the UK.,1
saying this is brainwashing is like saying events where school kids get to meet and talk to holocaust survivors is brainwashing. It's educating them about the world and trying to prevent harm... as you said,1
Spot on bro... People divide instead of unite... And that is what the elite wants. This war agaist races is total bs... All lives should matter. There are bad and good people of all ethinicity,0

I have a classmate who is bisexual (it’s a girl) and she absolutely loves girls but she can’t be in an open relationship because her parents would despise her if they ever found out. Being against someone who is LGBT is basically being against people’s existence and everyone has the right to live their lives as they see fit.

The elephant in the room just needs to be mentioned. When we say Black Lives Matter a lot of people don’t understand what it really means so they call it racist.  I Know people that are white and Hispanic that held up the sign during the George Floyd protest. The reason why they did this was not  because they wanted to be black But  because they knew what it meant . In short it means that we matter  to but we feel like people that aren’t our color in general don’t recognize that we do. We know all lives matter everybody should know that. God loves us all but we don’t love us all.,1

It's PC to be pro-Muslims and feminist. Gabby Aossey took this knowledge and ran with it while trying to decide what to make an article about. Being prudishly PC seems to be a valid replacement for intellect and having insightful,1
@Nick Franco you said it better than anyone I've heard speak about it.,1
Imagine if after Martin Luther King jr’s “I have a dream speech” white peoples went around shouting “all colors have a dream too” nnLike seriously 🤦‍ do you guys have to make everything about you nnnBlack peoples are trying to fight for justice by saying they matter nnAnd you white people have to come out of nowhere screaming all “lives matter” 🤦‍ seriouslynnThis fight for their justice  has nothing to do with you people and yet you sorry asses want to jump in every black protest and make it about y’allnnthats just playing white privileged right there,0

@Jimmy Pop  Yeah I get what you're saying. There's some things I just can't get past. I honestly feel these last two album(s) she's made have been extremely dark. There's things that I've picked up where my conscious tells me 'that doesn't sound or look right.' You know? I often ask myself when listening to one her songs,1

moonlight hun all I said was a valid point,1
That intro music should come from DOOM 64 or Resident Evil 4. Also you seriously need to post these on sound cloud. I would listen.,1
Ya my existence isn't some sort of opinion or stance on something. All I hear when someone tells me i just don't agree with it is that they are intolerant. I welcome someone to change my mind,1
Britian should pay reparations to india and africa nThe eastnIndia company,1
What happen to the white people though?... I’m not racist ! I adore black,1
Is it really up to interpretation when the Bible says things like a man lying with another man is an abomination and punishable by death? I really can’t fault anyone for reading that passage and coming to the conclusion that God is not approving of homosexuality.,1

VeryPoliticalHonkey Um ok?,1
I was talking to my mother a lot about LGBT lately and I was going to show her more videos and articles about it but I'm afraid that she'll realize why exactly I do that. sometimes I forget that she doesn't know who I am (and I'm not even sure who I am but I'm definitely not heterosexual). sometimes you feel like it's too hard to keep lying but you know that you can't tell anyone,1
@Mayi Solar Canudas wait she did? is there a video or something because i would love to see that,1
I'm pretty sure she is.,1
@Heather Boyd You are right.,1
Every life matters. BLM is no better than ANTIFA.,1

Juan you are a MORON.  Next you'll say there is no black on black violence,1
It's says if a black persons life does not MATTER THEN HOW CAN ALL LIVES MATTER????,1
Police violence matters. The more crime the more police violence. How did the police become so alienated for all of us? Why did they become militarized? Everyone suffers because of the the rampant criminality in our ghettos,1
Ugh.  Juan Williams is such a douchebag.,1
if you can't see the logical fallacy,1
it means we don't agree with sin .,1
I don't care about either side stay away from me.,1

i like that it was in toronto. i live in canada. the most racist province you can find yourself in is Alberta because its essentially the texas of canada. Toronto and British Columbia are the most diverse and inclusive places to be. while i won't say racism doesn't exist here,0

I hate most WWE fans sorry but It does not mean blm it is actually and insult to the black community. Maybe you should read my last comment and maybe you’d understand a little better of what I mean. I hope it helps you,1
@TheCounterpointer​​ What a load of sexist bullshit. Gtfo.Men earn more than women in all fields specially married men and those with kids while women loose careers because of companies who don't even provide maternity leave.Men are NOT discriminated in education,1
@Anna Thompson Newsflash! Sexuality doesn't define who you are as a person. Disagreeing with homosexuality isnt disagreeing with existence. Learn your facts.,1

This made me tear up today. Such an important conversation to have. Thank you so much! I would love to add to this conversation the notion of unique responsibility as Dr. Marc Gafni has responded to the classic conversation 'a rap on race' between Margaret Mead and James Baldwin (which you can also find on YouTube). Please watch  A Covenant Between Generations - Beyond Collective Guilt',1
madness ...but what we dont hear is a apology or a admission of guilt from the state institutions  ( like the police )for all the innocent lives they have taken .. instead,1
@Horror Kid101 Also,1
im a lesbian I  am 19 right now and I just got out of Conversion Therapy a  month ago it was pure abuse I say its no fun they didn't hit me with a bible but they have me in a locked room with nothing in it like I was insane and read the bible on a loud speaker and not feed me I don't see how this is allowed they throw holy water in my face and say I came from the devil and here I am out of Conversion Therapy  still a lesbian I wish they new they didn't change me,0

Panji Rizki the term homophobic has a historical relationship with the AIDS epidemic. Fear of LGBTQ can be based on or surrounded by fear of HIV/AIDS during the last century. I’m not sure anyone who disagrees with your faith would associate that with any malady. Though,1
I think in general we all get along pretty well. Even with some democrats.,1
I really love this interview. All the pretension is gone. No phony accent. No self-inflation. Just insightful reflection and real humility.,1

You know you got to love madonna.. but i find these questions were dam hard .. omg i was getting scared,1
Those who boo'd are the ones who find excuses for themselves,1

Madonna is not female. Madonna is trans.,1
Sheriff talks like he''s reading from a script with his robotic responses,1
How about only Christian lives matter.nThat's what I think but I dont go around saying it because it would give Christians a bad name. Jesus wants everyone to worship him. I will never understand why anyone wouldn't.,1
I don’t agree with not being able to just pretend. Seems like it’s just about pride at that point. If you’re getting physically hurt for being who you are with nowhere to turn,1
TheLegend27 Is Okay so yeah! I am using stereotypes what are you gonna do about it?,1
Just because she disagrees with homosexuality doesn’t mean she’s homophobic,0
To me it seems like Annie is confused about her own stance on the LGBT community. She didn’t seem so sure about any of her answers and maybe if she wasn’t influenced by the people around her she would understand better,1
@Pink Chalk I hope you succeed! Good luck to you and all the women out there!,0
Is it also controversial to say Everybody and Everything Needs Love? Can we say that without offending anyone.,1

That would be uh pure mean,1
If all Lives matter....why do we have Abortions?  Anybody?,1
Agreed it’s the people vs our corrupt world,1
this all a publicity stunt from the dems,1
@Mr. carpenter bee maybe I should have used the word indoctrinate not brainwashed. nobody forces an adolescent to believe in a religion but they are more prone to believing certain views if they grew up with that religion being the norm. But if they leave that community and are able to think outside that norm then they might question several aspects but when someone is under a certain age they just go with the flow of their communities norms unless it causes them pain. There have been many LGBTQ youth in religious communities who are shunned when they come out. Just think of the implications and pressures someone has to go through when their community does not accept them. in my opinion,1
AKA conversion torture,1
@Luke B Ah did not know about Pride wanting to have no police company outside of their participants. Still that should have nothing to do with option for Pride to call police for help.nnStill sounds silly. Police in first place should be conscious about enforcing law both on citizens and within themselve.nThat is what I am paying taxes for. Not for them to prance around doing nothing but looking good.nThat is different business called Modelling.,1

I’m stunned by the number of sexist comments by males here. What’s more interesting to me is why so many males are insecure about the fact that women are entering the field of engineering. This isn’t a war - what are you so afraid of? That your masculinity/intelligence is under attack? Well,0

Undead Unicorn It is. Even if you support them but have a all lives matter T-shirt on they target you as a racist. They did it to a kid in OR last night even though he came to support the rally. I agree we have some bad cops and they need more training but it's not a race issue.,1

@AtlantisMystic Walker #12894 thx a lot bro cuz rly thx you are just one of those people who just understand everyone and the reason why I typed that was because at that time all my Muslim friends (cuz I live in an Arab country and I am a Christian) were SCREAMING bad stuff about people who were LGBTQ+ and unfortunately a few of them were at my house while we where watching yt we found this vid in recommendations and they told me to type mean stuff against this dude(in the vid) and I AGREED like a butthole and scrolled down the comments and saw this comment and I just rage commented on this dude here (the dude in the comments).

Bisexual Unicorn here and I absolutely love this video. These kids were so darling. I feel bad for this poor man though. Why can't people stop pushing their beliefs on others?

What happen to Sheriff Clark?,1
The fact is that racism points fingers in All directions. There are both good and bad people of all cultures and nationalities. To say ALL LIVES MATTER does NOT exclude African Americans. It would be a constructive peaceful way of bringing us ALL as equals. Now ALL LIVES MATTER would promote putting an end to racism once and for all.,0

I just want to point out that the Bible does not say that homosexuality is a sin. The passage that I’ve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. “Men shall not lay with man” was originally meant to read as “man shall not lay with boy”. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship. Incorrect translations and interpretation of God’s words are harming real people on a daily basis.,0

I highly value Black lives I have traveled to Nigeria twice and to Rwanda twice to teach workshops on how to save newborn babies at birth.  These babies happen to be Black and I have worked in hospitals to save people of all races.   My understanding is there are a whole lot more black lives lost though in the United States due to Violence among the Afro American community in impoverished neighborhoods.   To focus on the police as a critical solution to the loss of Black lives and to take actions that are not precisely calibrated will result in a great increase in the loss of Black lives.   The police have been serving the Black community.   Yes there have been incidences of abuse by police just as there have been nurses that purposefully killed their patients but we don't decide to get rid of nurses because of these few  crazy ones.   After all Black lives matter right?,1

The problem inherent in this situation arises when the BLM movement embodies radical principles that threaten the lives of other groups or lawful systems.r  The movement's dynamic shifts from peacefully calling attention to the oppression of the black race to radically lashing out with violence or hate speech under a logic process that can be summed up as two wrongs make us right.

@stick Lonnie Stevens No! Black lives are the most oppressed ones. White's are the least. The problem is black lives are oppressed and that's what BLM is trying to solve. Don't be mad because ur race isn't included in this. You shouldn't want it to be! You should be grateful that u don't need one that's why I don't support alm movement. Not saying that all lives don't matter,1

To me that means - why don't white people care enough to march for their own killed by police. It's not about how loud black people are - it's about how quiet white people are. If you find injustice scream about it. You think doing this kind of thing is easy! Coward maybe?,1

Hold up. I saw the comments and I was looking for that little girl.... Now I just realized who the little girl is... How butch!,1
@RobloxMegaGX Gaming how people are treating black people...,1
@Jake L When one political party owns most of the lying media and openly commits treason (aiding and abetting illegal immigration,1
My thoughts exactly. Style is style though,1
Point 1.  Mainly Men are engineers because naughty society. nPoint 2. You claim that Women can be engineers because there is no difference between men and women.nPoint 3. You THEN claim that women will bring something to the engineering table that men cannot!nDo you see how point 2 and point 3 are incompatible? nIt makes no sense. nnLet me ask you a question. nWhy did you feel weird in engineering courses because you are a woman. nnIf you stop thinking of yourself as a female engineer,1
Conversion therapy sounds like it can cause someone to commit suicide..no seriously...,1
Evil half the time? So you know her? Are you assuming based on?,1
Do you want a link to a video that shows just that? ‘Cause I found 4 in under 10 minutes. Just because the media isn’t shoving it in our faces,1
David Clarke speaks the truth because he sees it firsthand everyday. He knows that black peoples biggest problem is the dysfunctional culture that THEY created and perpetuate. If any of those pussy politicians really believed that black lives mattered,1
My life matters to. Not just black people,1
Jessica Walker I respect you for sharing your opinion and having to defend it against these triggered people. God Bless,1
The witch. Oh I'm so good... Look how she treats people in her circle. His brother. Her sick deliver of  agendas. She's a puppet. And an Ugly one by now,1
This was extremely inspiring,0
@Callie S The problem is countries like India and China are bursting with people and Japan,1
I meant it isn't the protesters fault either-,1
Slavery at that time was legal and more profitable for Africa. Stop thinking that slavery was kidnapping people. These statues remind us the past,1
Imagine people see this in the future and think what kind of humanity is this,1
I mean good on them? But how long till they pull out the sledge hammers and start bringing down buildings that are “built on slavery”?,1
@Revenant lmao well your not seeing what ur Asian brother and sisters are going through maybe do some research buddy,1
You mean in America.,1

Schlatt Coin white lives have always mattered but people say all lives matter but then black lives clearly don’t matter if innocent black people are being killed for no reason,1

@1990m trich history lmao,1
Its disgusting people boo when said white lives matter. If we want to be equal then act equal,1
@Theodore Haskins You are completely right. Your mind is closed. Someone above clearly told you black lives are included in all lives but you don't want to hear that because your mind is so closed and narrow that you are oblivious to anything anyone can say.,1
Aless Aless the way you quoted “rights” makes me think that you are just another ignorant racist,1
You can't fit all that text in a five pointed star. You don't really have to be a digital designer to figure that out.,1
Life is a gift from GOD,1
@Randomgirlwhosings0804 You can't disagree with someone's very existence without being bigoted. I disagree with being a black person sounds incredibly messed up,1
You are literally that dumb? White people aren't living in fear of their lives every single day simply because of the color of their skin. The real question is why do poor Americans lives matter less than the stock market? Why are we asked to go back to work during a pandemic to l just for the stock market and corporate profits? Why did corporations get a gigantic covid bailout and people got enough for a month or two of rent and food if lucky?,1
Good thing that they factor in age,1
Don’t embrace either side,1
Imagine the opposite of the BLM Toronto situation. Imagine the cops blocking the parade and not allowing it to proceed until they were given money,1
The way I see it,1
The truth is.... These so called protesters would still be wearing masks even if there was no Pandemic.... You get my point...,1
@Shayne Berg i was being sarcastic but that works too,1
I got more coloured friends than white and they would do for me as they would for their own and I for them. Maybe all those that disagree should move the country where men depend on each other for God and family.,1
make a sense because all live matter will be including (animal,1
The fact is that the Democrats and political left  DO NOT care about the lives of black people.  They care about their leftist agenda,1
Yeah a cop standing on someone’s neck on video tape is just in our  imagination.,1
I am so grateful to live in an environment where I rarely get to hear things like engineering is not for women. When I was little,0

@openworld poland You are saying the obvious and getting all defensive because black people have that audacity to want black lives to matter as well.,1
So 77.9% of people don’t matter but 12.1% of people do matter.,1
I owe nothing of my struggle to her.  Why does she still belong to the Kaballa Cult that claims it can cure Homosexuality?,1

WHY THE FUCK IS BERNY NOT OUR PRESIDENT,1
My dad read a poster when out at the shops today and it said in the last five years police have killed 1262 black people and 2412 white people. That's almost double white deaths to black deaths. Are white people out there shouting white lives matter n tearing stuff down? All lives matter. Its racist to separate our races,1
black lives matter is racist,1
@??? Lol what? Why can't she? Because she'll offend you? Aw,1
@Dus Bus that  movement that went trembling at lawrenceville?,1
@BallisticPacifist first off that's not logic. You said A is C therefore  B is C... not exactly logical. Secondly the things listed sets off septers and things in our brain giving us dopamine. These things are created for those purposes. My argument is that sexuality and homosexuality attraction are thing created,1
Only logic n truth matters,1
@Lincoln Terry No need to apologies. It's not something that is 'advertised' or even discussed outside of academia or LGBTQ+ communities.,1
This whole thing is a huge hypocrisy. They don't seem to care about those victims of black on black crimes one but. Yeah,1

whats racist is black people getting killed for simply being black,1
BigDaddyEddy I am caring about the real problem by pointing out the issues that the slogan is causing. If the slogan was “black lives matter too” there wouldn’t be comments such as “all lives matter” or “white lives matter” etc. People wouldn’t feel threatened by it and there might actually be progress with the real problems at hand!,1

POLICE LIVES MATTER. I BELIEVE THE COP IN FERGUSON WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF. I KNOW THE STORIES AND watched them all. that cop had every right to protect himself. he felt threatened and Michael Brown did try to get the officers gun so the officers life would have been at risk so like anyone trying to protect themselves the officer did the right thing.,1

Daiyan Farrel Keigo Hartono BLM are protesting across Europe and the UK...it’s not just the USA these protests are occurring.   One of my points is for the BLM spokespersons to look at the big picture and give a voice to modern day slaves who are currently bought and sold from within the African continent.  Asian people are employed under false pretences of employment and forced into the sex trade or slave labour.  So rather than wasting all that energy looting and ripping statues down why don’t BLM focus and protest on something that’s happening right now.  Pulling a statue down achieves nothing!,1
ImAlfie I agree! But I don’t think anyone made her say that. What if she actually believes in the Bible maybe?🧐,1

@NOXISUM you really couldn't have been more racist with that comment. I'm African American and I support the all lives matter statement. You sit there and say white people make it about them. Uhhh no it's not just white people its every other non black race and they're not trying to bash this protest. But why can't it just be about police brutality and racism in general. Black people and white people get hated on all the time and that goes the same for Asians and Hispanics. The all lives matter thing is saying police brutality needs to end and so does racism. And do you really think black people aren't racist against white people. I just saw a video of a group of black people beating the sh!t out of white people and setting their cars on fire. Like what kinda response is that. It seems like you think only black people know struggle racially or otherwise and that's just not true.,0
..is this funny,1
Those who killed Jesus are the main orchestrators when it comes to divide and conquer... that's why they control main stream media outlets,1

This country has given these people EVERYTHING! Half a billion Africans would gladly trade places with them.,1
It is actually one of the main reasons - a lot of research has been done on the subject. An absence of social influences to go into STEM fields is one of the biggest problems. The reason why they drop out after they get to school is again due to the social influences - this time negative from their peers. Also,0
WHY WE CAN´T NOT COMMENT ON FOX VIDEOS THAT PUSH THE LIES ABOUT ALL THIS LEFTIEST GAME??,1
It is ironic that these same protesters are those who are against reopening the economy! Instead of protesting this meaningless cause and making demands,1
I can see a few people got a bit angry. I am not defending the slave trade but instead giving u more information so u can make your own opinion instead of believing everything the leftist media tells u,1

@PortugueseLMPAO Don't ever say that. I think you're amazing!,1
Funny how some people concerned black lives mattering more then other lives,1
Racism is HYPOCRISY! Every person does'nt deserve to be treated like this People don't realize that they think being black or a coloured person don't belong in their community and not a citizen! Black people are also a person! We need to respect and unite each other whatever race or coloured person we are! I come from asia &  i support all of the black people or community! #BLACKLIVESMATTER,1
She even has her jeans cuffed! (I think that's how you spell it ),1
@WerebatnI am not sure why I stated that - maybe I was thinking of another comment. Maybe it was because you say that she is not an engineer. I don't believe that you HAVE to be an engineer to encourage females to go into the field - anyone can do it. So,0
That fact that this channel didnt disable dislikes and likes or comments shows how great the channel is,1

Hepo Slis I don’t understand a word u just said,1
For people who were judging Annie (and I read that she has come out now but I'm not sure if that's true) I was the same way when I was younger because I grew up in a religious family. But I was really really confused and hated myself because I couldn't understand why God would hate me if I like girls. Which for me made me try to prove even more that I didn't like girls at all. I finally left the religion two years ago and came out as bisexual. It's really scary if your family is homophobic and tell you that you are damned forever for that...,0
I’m a proud Bi girl and I could never image going to conversion therapy. I’m so lucky to have supportive ppl in my life. He’s very brave. These kids are very respectful!,1
@Bbm add#11 Nobody mentioned abortion and it isn't killing babies. Go to a different thread if you want to discuss your views on that.,1
@Bulldawg Moore You can think of your own one but this is a black lives matter video so I did this.,1
my first reaction was you are 100% a lesbian baby,1
xBrownskinAngelx Imagine white people protesting that White Lives Matter...same concept. “Excessive interest in oneself or physical appearance” may fit the narrative.,1
I find it offensive that you say Close your eyes and picture and engineer. You probably weren't envisioning Debbie Sterling.  Way to propagate stereotypes,1
@ERIC SÁNCHEZ no you are wrong because we are all entitled to our opinions but as soon as someone disagrees it's a problem,1
Most pointless and vain protests made in the worst moment possible,1
here for the update if your account is still active,1
For you thickheaded folks that don’t seem to understand what BLM means... it DOES NOT mean that the lives of other races don’t matter or don’t matter as much. It is a response to America showing us that Black lives have not mattered equally to other lives. BLM is simply a reminder that,1
@Jake Harrison That's your opinion man.,1
If we went back in time ....?.....Time only repeats itself at one point ..and...if not for time ....the.further is a null.  With that said..how does one move forward with no past behind them to learn form?  This all brings me back to a game I played when I was a kid...The Barrel of Monkeys....and...the Mouse Trap,1

@Average Murican statistics wise yes more White people are killed by Cops then black people.   But Also Statistics Wise more (Unarmed) Black people are killed by Cops there's a Difference.   Also Anyone Who has a Counter Protest like All Lives Matter are a Racist or Bigot because they don't care how many (Unarmed) (unjustly) Black people are being killed so once White privilege is Taken away ND White Supremacy we will have peace.,1

@Dirieh Ngongo Black lives mattered since the civil rights act was passed in 1964. Everyone knows black lives matter in the modern day and age. But you cannot shy away from the fact that there are and always will be individual racists by constructing a movement that is completely counterproductive to the African American community. Blaming it on factors such as systematic racism that clearly doesn't exist for black people. Let's take college acceptance for example. A black candidate for being a student in the school premise is more sawn after than a person of yellow colour with the same qualifications. Now tell me how you guys have it worse that isn't of your own doing. By creating this victim mentality you literally take all hope away from them with the lies you radicals have created.,1
BLM is indeed an organization who has their own beliefs and stand for different things. But BLM is a statement or phrase that stands for the fact that black lives matter too. Please don’t take our phrase and try to make it political. It’s not some political agenda. It is used to signal black empowerment. We don’t all agree on the political side of the BLM organization,1

@S. Tagerius I was really impressed with your ability to communicate the horrific implications of conversion therapy and support of the LGBT+ community.. but completely shocked and disappointed that you are advocating that abortion is killing a baby.

@Melissa Rose No one. It's a fictional story. They didn't exist.,1
not gonna lie... sounds like a horse race. All lives matter no matter who you are,1
Some of the black lives matter people are doing things correctly to protect their people but there are some that are destructive against innocent people and bad people too.When someone says black lives matter it is rude to say all lives matter because the purpose of this movement is black protection for their people and it’s rude to bring other lives to erase its main purpose.Its like saying “My cousin died help me”then person two replying who cares mine died too.Respecting personal rights means world peace .,0
It's that internalized homophobia pals,1

They care about the money also. The leaders are getting big bucks to create all this chaos. The rest are either crack heads or bored rich and semi rich kids looking for action.  Also maybe to get back at mommy and daddy for some trinket or such that the kid wanted. When they didn't get it they joined the BLM movement. Same as those celebs from Holkyweird cause it's the newest thing to spend their money on so they can feel good about helping some poor kids starving. nThey don't realize the devil has a grip on their souls.

@Jo Van Almen I mentioned that previous comment,1
There is a special place in hell for people that say black lives DONT matter because they do. I may be white but just because of our skin color we shouldn’t be treated different <3,1
for change ment a lot for me emotional,1
@ScotJockMcTartan yeah !,1
Can one you explain what non binary and genderfluid means ? Most of my friends are apart of the LGBTQ+ community.  I just wanna understand a little better,1
Can any black person that is protesting do me a favor and say this word? “ we have been quiet for so long and now ur not letting 1M+ people do what they want to do? It’s been so long that Martin Luther said something that everybody agreed on except u guys? U guys need to stop then we will stop. STOP KILLING PEOPLE! There is even white people protesting and ur not even accepting anything. U guys are polices u should protect the country not killing black people that didn’t even do anything”,1
@Heather well we all have different ideas of what looks good,1
All lives mater,0
All lives matter when Black lives matter,1
if black lives matter why they not out there protesting for that female black police officer that got killed in the Bronx by a black man,1

I do not like the comments about the girl with short hair. She is a child,1
So inspiring!! Thank you,1
What are you even saying. I don’t think this whole thing is about politics. Kids are capable of understanding what blm means. All it means is black lives matter. And believe it or not some cops ARE racist. This whole this is not democrat vs republican like some are painting it to be.,1

Including the kids who sewed the coat,1
as much as I don't really agree with annie she was really polite about it and respectful,0
Mine as well. so it pains me when i see people in comment sections saying these awful things about her. the worst part is that i cant seem to stop myself from engaging in conflict with them.,1
lives matternIf you put a color in front of lives you are racist,1
@Lauren Ray they are right,1
@TheLegend27 Is Alive you do realize we sin everyday right? Let people have there own beliefs,1
Obviously white lives matter but you’re missing the point. That’s like saying when there’s kids being killed left and right and someone starts a “Kids love matters” movement. Saying “All live matters” or “Adult lives matter” is undermining the message. Obviously all lives matter. But it’s not black lives matter and not anyone else. They are saying their lives also matter.,1
The democratis are basically saying that they don’t matter,1
I think the girl in the pixie may be having some thoughts of her own. Not judging a book by the cover,1
I thought you were talking about young girl in the brown sweater. I hate her,1
I fear this behaviour towards our police and our country will demonize them in the eyes of people who are not prejudice and only perpetuate the opinions of those who already are,1
considering most people using BLM in their lexicon are more racist than the racists they're fighting,1
Trilly Nomics  dumbass .. THATS TOTALLY WHY IN ALL THE PAINTINGS OF THE HOLOCAUST AND FILMS THERE ARE ONLY WHITE PEOPLE OF THAT OF FAIR ISRAELI SKIN BITCH I SEE NO BLACK,1

The banks  are making war against  the citizens,1
Yeah black lives matter sounds racist as all hell and Im almost certain you are a racist if you boo all lives matter I mean fuck you what makes your race specifically so much more special than all other races.  At the very least they could have called it black lives matter too at least that indicates to some degree that you give a shit about other people other than your own kind.  I swear you need to think when trying to start a movement like this.,1
All lives matter. If only black lives matter,1
Why are we giving politicians and Democrats this pleasure. ALL lives matter end of discussion,1

Fox. No one cares about your token based black guy takes. Tucker is the only man doing things right and saying what needs go be said,1
Hai Huynh I do do research and that does happen. I feel like you’re only looking at black people who are getting killed and dismissing the other races that are also getting killing in the same way. Have you seen the videos about random bricks being left in the middle of protests? Or how there are triangle holes being left in glass windows where riots and looters happen. There’s under cover stuff going on. Blm is pretty much like a cover up for an agenda to take place. It’s making people have hate in their hearts and causing destruction. That movement isn’t helping anything at all but only making the left come up with up ways to continue salving people who are black.,1
@hello kitty there is a website you can donate to blm supporter's,1

Do you not see how saying all lives matter gaslights and undermines blm? You need to understand when someone says blm they are not saying other lives don’t matter they are saying black lives matter too. Blm just wants people to treat black people equally not above or below.,1

I love what the sheriff said and it is what I’ve been saying this whole time. Does a black life matter when it’s in the womb?? Because nobody is protesting for those babies. It’s a statistical fact that more black Americans abort babies than any other American race. If all those babies were alive today there would be more opportunities for there to be black police. Black government officials. Black politicians. And etc.... so yeah. Until all black babies stop being aborted,1

Thank god she didn’t wear those stupid grills.,1
OMG sounds like a bunch of unattractive women whining.,1
God did NOT create the human races,1
Very reasonable and well thought out. I agree and further more can add that a number such as the ratio of men to women in engineering fields does not show there is a problem. Rather this demonstrates that despite a  level playing field women as a whole don't want to be or may dream about it but are not willing to put in the work as frequently as men are. I was listening to a consultant for law firms talk about female lawyers and the legal field has a hard time hanging on to female partners after 30 years old. This iss not based on their skills because they will have earned their place,1

the kiling got noting to do with race,1
The problem with saying all lives matter is due to it only being said as a response to black people when they want justice for extra-judicial killings by police. I've never seen the all lives matter crowd when a white person was extra-judicially killed,1
Just to add though,1

Jeff Davis 1. Who is they? 2. Black lives matter is not saying that black lives are superior or matter more.

+J Brown and another thing before you get angry about what I said just ask yourself this question how many life of white officers died protecting people so they could say all that blacklivesmatter died cuz I live around Dallas and I kid you not I back the blue did their lives not matter are you saying that your life is better than theirs,1

Keira Alahna i really hope you’re not being serious...,1
The problem is that there is no way to reasonably or logically argue against LGBTQ without saying the word god.  The separation of church and state is a thing.  The problem we have with Christians is that they are trying to legislate the rules of their religion into law and putting religion above people in disowning and/or kicking out their kids or other family members for being LGBTQ.,1

Hey TJ what do you think about the new black guy shot in car? for me its more like an aspirant for Darwin Awards . telling the police officer that he have a firearm while reaching for his wallet for ID. however  you know what i find funny ? .. that here in Czech Republic,1
only all lives matter nobody cares what black lives matters have to say about that all lives matters and always will and the truth is BLM won't be paid attention to again here in about a year because all lives matter need to go ahead and get together and start their Rally's  to with their t-shirts and I was wondering when the next all lives matter March will get together. Somebody needs to start that that has some influence. Go President Trump Republicans have your back.,1

@Timmy Mans how do you know?,1
Black Lives Matter! Not all lives. By saying this doesn’t mean you don’t believe other lives matter. It means you understand the amount of black brothers and sisters getting killed by police brutality. I’m Indian and proud to say Black Lives Matters! Stop killing my fellow brothers and sister.,1
Where did this sheriff come from? He just set black people back 50 years.,1
I know many girls with short hair who aren’t lesbian... Annie included she’s been one of my best friends for a long time. Seeing these comments crack me up because like others say,1

This is great! As a middle school science teacher I know and see how our culture does not seem to support females in science. I've started engineering projects this year and they have been well received by all (boys and girls).nnIn reply to the comment about men not being in elementary Ed. I don't see men as not being encouraged to be teachers. There is no culture saying men aren't smart enough to be teachers. However it seems girls may think they are not smart enough. A lot of it is misconceptions about what engineers are and do.nnIn response to the victim comment. She is being an example for young girls that even if you are told you can't do something you should try again and not give up. Teaching young girls to persevere and work hard is not a bad thing.,0

Judy Houtman yes covid19 is a lie to the extent that it is not a pandemic as it has a death rate lower than the flu. If the infection rate is higher it's irrelevant if the death rate is 2 in 10,1

Yeah. Most of what's presented are the bad news,1

She is a sell out to the beast system. Money fame all came as she sold her soul. She has been a big supporter and promoter of sinister life style. This is how you stay on the top,1
People say black lives matter because historically they haven’t mattered at all.  I’m not saying they are all systemic victims like some on the left but I’ve seen them get profiled by the police looked at and treated differently today in 2020. We have to have empathy for that. It doesn’t mean they are all victims of racism but some are.,1
As yet another white male in the tIT technical area I support and salute all of you!  Keep kicking ass.  I've encountered many very technical women and they're just people.  Just technical minded people.  I've never treated them any differently than a male.  Shitty this isn't the case for the majority.  Again keep kicking ass!  🤘,1

When they started booing at the white life matters that kinds hurted me tho-,1
yes. the point of black lives matter is actually to make all lives matter,1
hetrodoxly sonov Sure they will 🤣,1
I honestly think it should be changed to Black Lives Matter Too.  That acknowledges that All Lives Matter without diminishing the emphasis on  black lives.  It quiets,1
I love that sheriff. Amazing guy.,1
Oh nono N O their bi,1
And a lot of things are going way too far with violence and things there was noone yelling racism before corona virus,1
I just dont understand why saying All Lives Matter is offensive. It literally includes everybody,1
White Lives Matter! White lives have been depreciated throughout decades. Whites are called racists because of skin color. Who wants to start a movement and march? We will accept all nationalities that will help honor white color. Don’t cause a white out! White privilege matters!!,1
@chanel TV i dunno but i got a job and if i get caught doing anything against this new order i will lose my job and livelihood.,1

Back in the old days there were no pink and blue aisles. In the 80s in my country there were few toys to choose from so the parents got what they could. Me and my sisters had a bucket full of building blocks a would play a lot creating adventures and stuff. I didn't like dolls or barbies because the joints could not be bent. We also borrowed our father's saw and files and we created stuff from twigs. Having less plastic premade stuff made us more creative,0
Jesus Chri-nI literally just saw this comment while she said that and it gave me a mini heart attack,1
Because its patently obvious that White Lives Matter. They own every in America. They're not stopped for looking suspicious and brutalised and murdered on the street for no apparent reason.,1
@Ed Jessup It's cute that you think her stance on LGBT somehow comes from a place of purity when she's done whatever outlandish means it has taken her to stay in the public eye. She isn't doing it to be a good person. She's doing it for attention. Grow up and stop idolizing fallable humans.,1

The slogan is not only black lives matter Can't you read?  .  You don't want to know the truth.  I know the Trumpian tactic is to call everyone else what you are yourselves.   Trump called Elijah Cummings a bully right before he died.   Who's the bullly?    He has not one ounce of compassion.  He only sasys things thaat sound halfway decent when he is reading something typed up for him.  As soon as he goes off script or gets to Twitter,1
“Black Lives Matter” doesn’t mean no other life matters,1
2020 is way more than anyone expected it to be.,1
All lives matters means everyone matters and BLM don’t like this because it takes away the power of their cause so now they trying to take it away!!,1
If all lives don't matter untill BLM is true and I know your note saying this     then your life doesn't matter so why would you be wanting to fight for black lives if your life doesn't matter,1

Jeff Davis statistically white people are born in a better economic situation than most black ppl. We also have a higher median income than the black community in every class. Black ppl also have a much lower chance of being accepted for a traditional mortgage. They also have a lack of access to health care which contributes to a lower life expectancy average than white ppl. I’m sure there are more examples of systemic racism but I’d have to research more. I hope this changes ur view.,1
Okay now we have al  the all lives matter people. You guys realise that we aren't saying other races don't matter we are just pointing out that black people are getting killed for their skin colour. Of course everyone matters but wth like are we really gonna focus on a dumb thing like this when black people are getting killed for their skin colour. Unbelievable,1

I didn't even know I liked programming until I took an intro cs course during my senior year of high school. nI always knew I had kind of an engineering mentality growing up because I liked taking scraps from the recycling bin and building random things from it. I even made houses for my dolls and ignored the store bought doll house my parents gave to me for my birthday.nThis really inspires and reassures me that I'm making the right choices for my path. I might even consider after i complete my computer science degree to go pursue engineering as well.,0

@bloodsoldierZ you see that the wrong way of thanking because it is keeping color separated one that should not be the case we are not different races we are one race the sooner we learn this the better off our world will be we are no different from the other we are all made of the same fabric we are all cousins we are all one race and that is the end of it things like black lines matter just keep everything segregated and that is what is sickening and that is what is wrong with the world. Do people not understand that certain members of elite keep these things going just for the destruction and hate all lives matter is a statement saying that we are all together in this it is not one against the other we need to stop the b*****.

@Darzo Xx  You know what? This response is kinda cool. I am not going to shame you for what for you believe because you have your own history and experience.  People are trying to engage and we can respectfully disagree. Having respectful discussions is the point. I think people want to talk rather than argue to prove they are right at this point. The slogan is supposed to be divisive to get people to talk,0

I'm so glad conversion therapy is legal in my state it has helped a lot of people oversee their mental illness,1
Y’all really need to let go. Yes we know all lives matter. That’s a given. But the reason why people have to say black lives matter “too” is because black lives have it mattered since the 1800s!!! We know like white lives matter that has been proven that white lives matter over all of her lives in America time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time and time again. Nobody has ever questioned if all lives matter. So that part of the conversation is over with and irrelevant. Now let’s concentrate on the lives that have not mattered in America. Please concentrate and focus on what needs to be done to help. Don’t concentrate on what needs to be done to perpetuate the current paradigm. It is time for a change. All lies has always mattered and white lives has mattered above all in black lives has mattered the least in America. Stay focused people..,0

Hydross 77 are you agreeing that blm matters before alm? or...,1
I'm sorry to say this but I don't think that she can do very much in order to inspire girls to become engineers with her product as it still heavily relies on the parents buying them. I believe that the real issue isn't getting girls interested in engineering but rather to prevent parents from pushing their kids into stereotypical roles because I think that the families that buy Miss Sterling's books are the same that would have also gotten their girls a variety of toys,0
I have to agree,1
Why? Because the world became a sad sad place full of snowflakes who get offended by literarly anything.,1

Let me tell you what,1
Mike F. Yes child prostitution is awful but quite frankly is unrelated to the topic of racism against the black community. I honestly don’t understand what point you were trying to make here. Are you suggesting racism isn’t an issue and people should stop whinging?,1
Will people PLEASE STOP pulling down public toilets for sea gulls,1
The news media insights the riots and hatred.,1
I guess they forgot to talk what's happening in seattle,1
Sooooooo brown lives dnt matter?,1
Btw don't apologize for offending anyone. Not saying whatever you want and holding back leads to suppression of speech which eventually leads to tyranny in short. Not many people know about why America was born . Yes they were slave owners but tell me one person in this country whos ancestors weren't owned from 3000 or more years ago till now. We all have been slaves. We are all still slaves to the monetary system really. We're still here fighting each other about color when there's a bigger picture just behind the lies you see everyday,1

@Molly Rebekah It's fine if you believe in him. But to make definite statements of his existence and expecting them to hold up as a counter point is foolish.,1
@Vanesa Criminal like you who is spreading hate on the YouTube comment section,1
From listening to them speak about their experiences I feel like most of them are externalising internal fears and prejudices they feel should exist and hold themselves back rather than there being some pervasive and rampant problem. Fewer women than men comprise the workforce but what is the percentage of women that study these fields and what is the percentage of women that actively search for a job in those fields?nnThis is a fairly emotional study of a few women that seem to have grown up with a belief that a bias existed and still does. This isn't a level headed representation of the industry today and leads to nothing but personal speculation. Completely pointless.,1
BLM is procrime and just ridiculous.,1
It’s actually rehabilitation just like an addict they under go rehabilitation,1
I don’t really understand the idea of people assuming people’s sexuality based on their appearance. Like we are fighting against stereotypes but still are using stereotypes.,0

@Hai Huynh  One thing that is left out and never clarified is the behavior of the person who is being sought by the police. Why is it a justification for that person to run or get away from the cops or do other things that will escalate the matter? You think it's OK to do things like that to the police? Does this give them cause to disobey and we should just let them off free just because they're black and their lives matter?  It's thoughts like these that have criminals getting out of jail and running free to continue doing crimes because dumb people think it's OK. Then when these criminals go out and hurt others,1

I want that COAT !!!!! Bless anyone who suffers from persecution.,1
@h5b12345 The point of her saying that she did not fit in was not because she's saying that she didn't have friends or that she was shunned. She did repeat the statement I do not fit in multiple times but that was for effect. It is called repetition for effect. But what she was trying to say was that she did not fit in because she was in a room full of OTHER MEN. That's the whole point of this TED Talk. She's not blaming on the lack of skills to become an engineer but rather pointing out a flaw in the societal view on gender norms here in the United States and the impact this has on kids and their decisions in the future. As a current mechanical engineer at the NYU School of Engineering,1

@leila lalala It's not that I am happy about being right about this. But I like to adhere to facts as opposed to mindless sentiment. So,1
You sound a little racist to me. My father is coloured and my mother is white. From my point of view blm is a hate group that doesn't actually care about black. Where is thier bleeding heart for all the blacks killed by black people? You wont hear a peep out of them but when a police officer shoots a thug they come out and protest. All lives matter! Red black white yellow we are all human beings.,1
I'm lesbian and one thing that bothers me is when supporters of LGBTQ get all mad when some people dont agree with us and call that homophobic. Being homophobic is way different then not agreeing with LGBTQ. Like the majority of these kids arent necessarily supporters and dont necessarily agree with it,0
Its the complete opposite at this point,1
Wouldn't it be racist to assume someone else is? Asking for a friend.,1
GUYS THE MOST PEOPLE WHO NEED HELP RIGHT NOW IS BLM'S nTHAT IS WHY WE ARE NOT SAYING ALL LIVES MATTER                                            nIF BLACK PEOPLE NEED HELP WE WILL CALL IT BLACK LIVES MATTER nIF LGBTQIA PEOPLE NEED HELP WE WILL CALL IT  LGBTQ+LIVES MATTERnIF ALL THE PEOPLE NEED HELP WE WILL CALL IT ALL LIVES MATTER,1

wulf67 what is your problem dude?,1
This was such a heartfelt Ted talk & really hit home for me as an industrial engineer in my senior year. Especially personally this week because I have dealt my whole college life with doubters and disbelievers in my intelligence and diligence & to realize I'm not alone in feeling alone was very awakening and motivating. I'm so inspired to inspire young females to dare to challenge societal pressures and expectations and open the minds of the close minded. An engineer once asked me what it was like to be in a mans world and I replied with I'm used to it and it's not a mans world,0

Saying all lives matter is like the same thing as going to the doctor for a broken arm and expecting a full body cast you can make the argument that all lives matter which is true but we need to fix what is broken first. Nobody is saying other lives don’t matter of course they do but black lives are the ones at risk right now we’re just saying we matter too.,1

There is nothing wrong with saying All Lives Matter.  nnHowever there is absolutely something very wrong with saying All lives Matter while at the exact same time standing against some lives. nnAll lives matter is the epitome of the serpent tongue language.nnThe same kind of language that was used when the constitution was written.nnWe believe in liberty and justice for All... while at the same time owning slaves.nnSaying one thing... while doing the other. nnIf people really thought All lives matter then they would stand together with Black lives Matter and support stopping Police brutality. Stopping police brutality is the goal and would help All lives because police brutality would stop for everyone.nnBut are they doing that? nNo?nThen how can they care about all lives? nnForked tounge language.nnWe're not fooled.nnBeware the serpent tongue.,1

There is a lot of men trying to discourage young men from doing. It's because they aren't really men. They are predators. They are simply weak people who aren't willing to take in a challenge they might lose. They try to convince the world there is more than the eye can see. Its like she says in the video they were all at the library. It's a matter of doing it most men aren't willing to do more than show up. When they see someone who is willing to put in the time. That person becomes a target because in order for them to keep their job they are going to quit going to happy hour after work and actually compete.,1
That doesn't make Britain's part in the slave trade justified and is frankly irrelevant racist apologetics,1

1. you spelled arresting twicen2. no-ones saying we should stop arresting anyone,1
@Lindsay McPherson No. They're clearly too stupid,1
That's not the point. The point is that black lives are the ones being thrown away in violent ways by police. Others aren't. White people's lives aren't being thrown away like that. White people aren't being murdered. That's the point. That's why we say black lives matter. Black lives are mistreated.,1

We can’t wait to meet him when you get one”. It’s so awful,0
Sorry but the voices are lost on me.  This group will never be satisfied.   Please stay far away from me black lives.,1

George Floyd was a 33rd degree Freemason and so was his brother and father. Whole thing was staged to cause chaos. Why do you think you’re being “rebellious” when you have major corporations and billionaire Jews funding BLM. I’ve seen videos of cops laying out piles of bricks before protests and spray painting “fuck 12” on there own cars. Do some research please and you’ll know what I’m talking about. We should all be outraged! There are racist elites running this country! We need to stop burning our city’s down because that’s what they want,1

@Mikey Inman so sad right. The rabit whole is so deep but people just get mad n dont even look up anything. Its just brainwashing. It breaks my heart because all this stuff the musicians do is all to hurt  others because they are loyal to the elites. But they are fully mk-ultra and totured themselves. Noone should go through that. Its horrible torture that u can barely break out of. Except for a few like britney spears kanye west ect. But they either get sacrificed or programed right back to make money from. The fbi even admits to the monarch programing mk ultra. They torture children and adults. I would never want to b in hollywood at all. People regrey so much after they sign that blood contract but they only basically get out through death cuz theyre too much of a risk to tell the truth. Many are telling the sick truth but even then they often r brushef off. Just research its right there.,1

The intention of Auschwitz is a museum to remember the terrible acts committed within it. The statue was a celebration and glorification of Colston. The statue should have been moved to a museum and both his philanthropy and slave trading mentioned alongside it.,1
I’ll be honest i live in Scotland so I believe the racism is not noticed as much here as everywhere else around the world. I give a lot off respect on the massive community coming togather for protests but this is creating a massive divide.

@Nibzu of Nibiru Any time these cretins open their mouths they are spreading racism as they are full of hatred like the racists that they are. nnI don't remember hearing them say anything about the actual racism their own kind in South Africa is committing on a daily basis.

@Cabin Dweller No one is even alive from the slavery times. People already died to make everyone equal n How is it that Asians who have been here for 1 or 2 generations has surpassed whites.  And resent blacks from Africa are about even. It is Democratic policy that hooked intercity blacks on government programs like crack dealers. Then try to blame slavery and racism.,1

@Michy Mooshroom then why change everyone else?,1
Madonna is often criticized and looked down on because she is such a strong advocate for undeserved and neglected populations. It’s not only due to her provocative nature. I was waiting for Madonna to say that she is sexually fluid and/or bisexual when asked why she is such an advocate for the LGBT community. I’m not sure if she is or not but always thought she was/is.,0

It's too many how does the police community justify this violent killing of black Americans? While the world watches and deflects against it? Silence is violence and there is only one right way to go #georgefloyd,1
I try to be open minded and listen to both the left and right news media but I constantly see just a bunch of so called adults talking over each other and no one listening thus no progress being made. Both sides do this. It's childish a waste of time. All it does is turn the viewer into a sour,1

@TheLegend27 Is Alive Plus the verse that is against homosexuality is in the old testament-- the testament for Judaism. The new testament is for the Christians. There's nothing in the new testament against homosexuality.,1

So only black lives matter,1
Good luck on trying to get a liberal on apologizing to anyone who’s against their agenda. These communist dems want to bury the middle class and turn the world into rich elites and bread lines for everyone else.,1

I think its racist to say black lives(or any skin tone) matters more then the others and if a white person said white lives matter of course that would sound insanly racist but to define and put into seperate groups >lives< by any skin tone black or white is racist in its self and you tell'em david clarke...also that juan williams is a nut case damn liberals.Bernie so failed that test in the debate as well cause he was trying to be politically correct lol,1

Wow another good TED speech but what I find shocking are some of the comments. You would think that by 2014 we wouldn't even be having these debates.n2014 and we are still B***t ing and moaning about gender roles.nnThe only weakness for females would be physical. They might struggle doing manual labor such as using a jack-hammer but mentally the are equal to males. Its just the way kids are programed. Most parents don't even do it intentionally but each gender is programed to do certain things so by the time they grow up they are on auto pilot. They can't tell you why they like doing this or that because they were program to do certain jobs while they were young. That's why each gender tend to do certain job.nnIts takes guts to say NO! I will be what I want to be.,1

In reality obama was not a great president and he was only praised because he was black his affordable health care just made the majority of people to pay for others and had 50% rise you are just proving the point that democrats want the black vote that is really only worth 15% of the American population,1

Madonna is brought up in the conversation .. but with Madonna interviews; no mention of Cyndi.  One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.  But both are very creative and passionate about their work.  Definitely two worlds colliding.,1

@Sam JAYROE  Dude what??  Have you Googled the definition of the blm movement?  “Black Lives Matter (BLM) is an organized movement advocating for non-violent civil disobedience in protest against incidents of police brutality against [black] people.”,1
This is the first time I've ever seen her like this.  She has changed.,1
Yes and it should of been sprayed all over the protestors and let them pay for there own hospital care,1
Please have this sheriff for the next black president,1
Yes - it would probably help if the government hadn't just killed 50 000 people.,1
Personally I do not have an exact conclusion of if there is or there is a lack of a god. I feel like religions have their standpoint on how they want to look at life and I think that aethiests have a separate way to look at our existence,1
Hey im going to study electromechanical engineer but i didt pay very attention to this.I never thought that all the student will be boys omg im scared where did i get?!,1
​@I hate most WWE fans  i hope your being sarcastic.,1
That's because your an idiot.,1
If everyone would look up definition of racism and apply it where it fits we be ok,1
maybe she is a closeted lesbian,1
So people are being boo’d at and killed (Jessica Doty Whitaker) for saying ‘All Lives Matter’? Sometimes I wonder if there’s hope for humanity.,1
You already know that Larry Elders are for the white people,1
@Joe Smith  CK out Candace Owens 24 min Congressional Hearing. This is exactly what she speaks of.... Interesting young lady. She's a Force,1
You should all read the old children's story,1
Ever see a statue of Hitler?,1
@Jessica Walker I actually agree,1
She's sad because it was an emotional evening taped on the same evening as the award show when she just gave her speech. Besides no one will ever allow her to age,1
They forget about the context and the reason why Black lives matter is a thing when they discuss Black lives matter and all lives matter. It should not be a problem to say all lives matter,0

Isn’t conversation therapy illegal ?,1
I love Asians!,1

Do you really wanna die on that hill in the name of pedantry?,1
BLM wants the genocide of white people,1
All these comments saying it's all left wings fault,1
And also she was let to speak and answer smart question,1
Have you ever heard of Martin Luther King? He was around before the internet. He got sniped for protesting against racial injustice. Shut the hell up. Cell phones are not the problem. The government system is.,1
Lol... “plantation politics,1
I remember that he said he is half-black,1
Terrible title by Sky. Outstanding action by the people.,1
Feminism are intolerant they get affanded easily just be youself,1
correct me if i'm mistaken,1
It's not disagreeing with the fact that the attraction exists and that people experience it; it's disagreeing with the opinion that it's okay to act on that attraction. nnPeople disagree about stuff all the time but still love each other and respect each other's validity and intrinsic value.,1
Thanks a lot from Poland. <3,1
you gotta hate Larry Elder...why?  He speaks with data...this man has more courage in his pinky finger nail than 95% of democrats and especially any liberal under 30.  Black lives matter...tell the black fathers,1
god bless trump in 2020,1
@FamilyFirst Well Democrats supported Obama,1
Police fear those who would dehumanize and kill them in cold blood because of some deep seated sense of entitlement,1
@GmV-arts it isnt. There is another better analogy.,1
The protesters (rioters) seem to favor the herd immunity strategy regarding the pandemic. No social distancing,0
These kids are really mature and understanding! nThe girl with short hair probably didn't grow up in a environment that allowed her to develop her own opinions and values,0
And western companies fund them. Evil exists regardless of race.,1
That mindset their is the problem,1
I think that people who put a black lives matter sign on their front lawn are probably overcompensating for their previous racism and should therefore be reported to black lives matter.,1
This statue is not a historic monument. It's a monument celebrating a historical figure. This person shouldn't be celebrated.,1
@it'sMe TheHerpes go move to N.Korea with Dennis Rodman.,1
NI LOYAL I think we should take all the last remaining Spitfires,1
White lives are not more important than black lives. Black lives have been over looked. How many Presidents,1

@J Brown Im sorry,1
He’s a great interviewer,1
These kids are much smarter than we think they are.,1
They don’t like every life matters because they are for the killing of babies in abortion clinics,1
BLM matters stop being so racist,1
You don't know that. It is still abusive which could lead to a lot more than you think.,1
She really did! Madonna was and is a revolution,1
Why are they teaching kids about this?,1
@Molly Rebekah so god lives all his children is some how forgotten,1
I’m not saying she’s queer or anything,1
I know everyone is commenting on the religious girl,1
Oh did someone huwt your feewings. Oh someone said its a male dominated field. Oh my how could they ( cite the statistics ),1
you were right at first statistically but now you just look bad,1
Are you Kitty Kat and Bentito offended by my comment?,1

Ahhhh I love it.,1
@Ashxr that's not the same thing for some people they believe sexuality is a choice whereas being black is what we are born into,1
#nolivesmatter we are all equally worthless,1
@A.J Mulenga Finally someone on this thread understands,1
Oooh it sure is a choice and they know it GOD does not make mistakes,1
+Yook Sungjae you say BLM is about black lives that are not acknowledged ??????? where is that clown al sharpton every time blacks are slaughtering other blacks ?!? which is by the thousands by the way. i just do not understand how people can support a group that shout death to all cops or who trash the very own cities they live in ( ferguson & baltimore) ??????????????????????????,1
I honestly had no idea,1
True but sadly everyone doesn't see that for themselves.,1
Black lives matter....is that not racist... all lives matter,1
David Clarke is correct! watching this again in 2019,1
And why because he was black geht mit so much Moby or No Job,1
@Vanesa What did you type?,1
@Vera a all lives matter. Regardless of your skin colour. By saying blm you're dividing us. Which is literally taking 10 steps backwards. How do u not see this?,0
If BLM really believed that black lives matter,1
@Sanjana Hegde even in third world countries most engineers are males.,1
@Eris  I think it's a mix or environment and hormones but at the same time in the end it's not a choice it's just based off of it all,1
Even the girl that said,1
All Lives Matter. Not Just Black.,0
Only the stupid will want their community to be the victims and be victimized.,1
It has been hinted that Bristol Council are considering a statue of  Priti Patel as a replacement for Colston!,1
You know you got to love madonna.. but i find these questions were dam hard .. omg i was getting scared,1
@Logan Schmidt all lives matter is not a counterprotest is a fact,1
i want to speak up and say that i agree,1
What's so amazing is that she knows firsthand of what she speaks. Who would know and why should you care? Live and let live right? It's all great except the deception part. What does it take to be famous and what does it cost? It's a dark and dangerous thing.,1
@Hello World and what is stating someones actions and personality racist?,1
Stop whining and just prove that you're capable of what you say your capable of,1
@The Real Rhetoric Exactly what I was thinking.,1
Amazing how those numbers are SO much better for all Americans and the dimocrats still hate our President Trump,1
Generational poverty is a thing. We need welfare reform that will help teaching people how to come off assistance. There is a gap that causes them to not be able to make the leap into success.,1
These people are crazy,1
The cost looks similar to something Michael Jackson wore,1
Although I'm not American,1
@Max StirnernIt's an old one too,1
To answer the title of this video,1
@Borninthe WrongCentury enjoy your indoctrination,1
I say it differently.  Human lives matter. If only black  lives matter then someone is racist.nWhen I  pull a man out of a  ditch  he's  not white or black or brown,0
@Kazi Ovi But they certainly have more female engineers than you do.,0
my future child better be that enlightened,1
@Canu Gizabit The Tony Timpa case has many similarities to the George Floyd case in terms of the way he was restrained,1
Kotori Minalinsky You’re so full of it. Remember they used to tell us,1
I agree with you,1
ALL LIVES MATTER NOT JUST BLACK LIVES. EVERYONE IS GODS CHILDREN. NO ONE IS ABOVE ANOTHER. WHAT WE HAVE SEEN CURRENTLY IS EXTREME MAOIST ATTITUDES. DEMOCRATS  ONLY PANDER TO THESE ANTIFA AND B.L.M. EXTREMIST GROUPS. -CCFP coalition of the conservative free people.,0
@Fari Escamilla this is why we should just change it to black lives matter too. As simple as that.,1
It's pathetic that people can be so easily swayed by the media! Ultimately you are making these corporations lots of money! Carry on,1
Why she's dressed like MICHAEL JACKSON,1

I agree. It's terrible brain washing,1
this looks like it was all a plan to get black people out in large groups together dureing a pandemic that kills more black people than anyone else,1
But I'm a cheerleader is a funny movie about that haha,1
I’m 12 and I’ve known I was into girls since I was 6. When I was 9 or 10 I didn’t know about homophobia and things so I came out to some of my friends ( I also didn’t know they were religious) and they told a lot of people at my school,0

Can I bring a wheel barrow?,1
@J. ROD I agree slavery was bad. But should we use our modern day judgement to justify wether or not they're bad. They didn't think like us. The things they've done were bad. Yes. But without them you and I wouldn't be here. We modern days humans think certain things in the past were wrong. They were normal back then. Yes? My main point is,0

@C J Exactly,1
It really sucks at least in america you have freedom of speech for now. I can't believe in 2020 we are still having skin colour prejudice and issues as a result it is pathetic if in millennia we can't get past something so simple as to understand that diversity is a benefit to our survival as a species we are doomed.,0
That's what I would say,1
No because they have real problems with the government oppressing them right now.,1

Conversion therapy is torture. The government should close all of those centers,0
All lives matter obviously. The BLM movement was created as a response to police brutality. People started the phrase “All lives matter” as a response to black lives matter in order to remove or dilute the movement,1
@MrCosmin94  What do you think happens to you when you    Die,1
@Cassidy Rae I never said that I supported them it's just annoying to see some christians think they understand certain parts of the bible when they obviously don't. Like in Corinthians 6,1

@BackYardTV yes they did lol there are letters from African Kings asking Europeans to stick to the trade ports instead of moving in land and stealing people from towns along there rivers. There was also court cases in the country of Bennin that were going to decide if the ancestors of royals  should pay reperations to those who they sold into slavery. They decided against it.nnAfricans don't even dispute this claim the only people that do is white western liberals and those who they teach. There is too much evidence to deny this.,1

everyone is hating on the girl who said she didn't agree with homosexuality. she has the right to her opinion and she doesn't have to agree with what others agree with. she never said that y'all are wrong or should burn in hell. she respected you. i don't understand why y'all hate on her,1
Sheriff Clarke we salute you for your honesty sir.,1
No doubt they all felt better afterwards ! Which one is next ? Ironic that all those protesters in Parliament Square,1
These debates are a joke. they just respond to claps and go with the yes this sounds right approach rather than doing literally any research into the statistics and psychology of the issues outlined by BLM. I am going to trust 150 years of proven psychology over a career oriented populatity participant any day,1
It shouldn't be. If one applied the Venn diagram,1
God gave everyone a choice. Heaven or Hell. Your choice to choose where to go. Sin is sin,1

Weather your white or black just think for a solitary second suppose you were white and it is all of a sudden that it was illegal to say all live matter and only black lives matter was allowed to matter how would that make your kind feel????nnIf I were all of you I would heavily think about not caring for only one nationality one race and only one skin color and think about each and every ounce of life that is on this planet because every single day everyone is killing one another and if you all don’t stop it’s going to keep on going until there is no more life on this planet nnAll life matters because all life is precious nnLike Hannity said if you all don’t have the courage to speak out and say ALL Lives MATTER then you all are political racist cowereds. nnGod bless you Hannity.,0
I hope you all saying corona is going to have fun know that the protesters are taking precautions almost everyone I saw was wearing masks or head/face protection in this video.

Who said other people racistly abused doesn’t matter. You can easily say white lives matter. AS LONG AS THEY WERE RACISTLY ABUSED,1
Saying black lives matter is actually the racist choice. Racism doesn't mean discrimination against blacks,1
yet ppl still dong believe that black ppl r created equal,1
Absolutely horrible that’s still a thing,1

B.

Way more white people are killed by police every year then black people you dont see us going around burning our neighbour hoods down over it do you?

@Linda B  @Taylor Bridges   Hey Dummy Maria Botina was a Russian agent that infiltrated the NRA. She laundered millions to Trump and she went to prison.nnSo is it illegal for BLM to support Democrats. If so lock them up the way Giuliani's boys Lev Parnas and Igore Fruman were arrested for laundering Russian cash to Trump and other Republicans. Oh I forgot FOX didn't want you to know that. nnOh you might want to know the Trump Foundation was shut down by regulators. Trump was using the money for himself.

blnstr blnstr How.. it’s kinda simple. They aren’t saying all lives don’t matter when they get mad at that statement. It’s like imagine that a bunch of people were protesting that “we should treat kids better as a society”. Something random like that. Then a bunch of 50+ year olds are protesting against the kids saying,1
Everyone of these stars who has had one successful album after another is part of the kabal music msm system based on sexualising everyone and selling it as 'freedom'; subverting family bonds and values which the atheistic industry abhorrs. nBowie,1

@JBPVFL I've just seen him go along with obvious bullshit narratives in the past.,1
Career choices depend on personality differences and result in differences in interest.  Women have different personalities than men and therefore they choose careers based around “people” 60% of the time.  Men choose careers based around “things” 60% of the time.  It’s biology not culture.  If a woman feels like she doesn’t fit in ANYWHERE,0

Ya'll are saying God wants us to love everyone. Get the love that God wants you to use straight. Different types of love are used. Loving someone with the same gender isn't love but lust.,1
Because there are MORE lives that matter and the last I checked saying all lives matter excludes NOBODY. But the devil is in the details and the Democrats are demons and they have done nothing to help the black community! I USED to be a Democrat until I did my own research and stopped listening to these BIASED DNC controlled media outlets. These are the times of REVELATIONS!! People are fooled and they are on the WRONG SIDE. For the people- Republicans. nDemocrats are for themselves and keep the black community in POVERTY!!!,1
Asiya you can't disagree with sexuality lmao- it's like saying you disagree with people being black,0
@Wren Linnet I have been reading recently that there are differences in how male and female brains work and how most women struggle in high intellectual jobs such as STEM. To be honest,1
You don’t get to “agree” not “disagree” with another person’s sexuality or existence! No idea why so-called “Christians” think they are entitled to have a say in other people’s lives...didn’t Jesus say judge not lest he be judged?,0

+J Brown let me also clarify something yes there are bad cops and by no means do I support them I'm just saying that before you go saying all the cops in the world are bad remember those cops does that sound a little more reasonable of an answer course it's going to be bad people that's bad everyone and I don't support those cops are bad cops in this world yes I agree with you on that and both live shouldn't matter that's what I'm trying to say,1

We are missing the best female talent. There may be females that are truly interested but not encouraged (as in told about engineering not forced) or bullied out of it (there have been studies that show capable females leave STEM because they are bullied by peers or faculty). I do not force anyone into a field they are not interested in - I have a cousin that would be capable but not interested. I tell her to do what she likes. But there are females that would like it - we need to find them. A diverse workforce makes it a better workforce. Crash tests were only conducted using males dummies until females engineers got involved and saw there needed to be tests on females as well! Females and males do approach problems in different ways,0

@Michael Paysour  Obama never bothered me but I know who hurt your ego Sheriff David Clarke he put it down you democrat,1
@Itzzz JayB it was implied in the second  comment,1
@Jack Parsons The love of money is the root of evil for many people. The hate of people with money is also the root of evil.,1
“Plantation politics” sums it up well.,1
They would have to step out of the hipnose. Só good to be doing things that friends in my group cheer.,1

@SHARK BITE according to the daily mail,1
You've just assumed a whole lot,1
Ok but why are they attacking peaceful,1
BrodyVeilleux all you do is call people names sir and I’m not a liberal I think whatever I want to think . I’m simply saying you’re rude and immature I’m not going to talk to someone like that . Bye ! Have a nice day! Edit,1
Or just paint the black ones white,1
Let me break it down for the people that don't understand.  Saying all lives matter is not offensive. It's good that YOU care about everyone's well-being. HOWEVER,1
I would have been fine with ALM if it didn't come right after BLM.,0
@ thanks..i can see where you are coming from too..makes sense you dont want to categorise people with their race..but i have to refer to the certain group of people somehow when talking about this issue..when i say black people or whatever it is meant in the least racist way..thanks for understanding me though,1
@bush bunyipnShhhh Not so loud,1
+Ron La Manna  we need to give him an oval office.,1
@Troy White so the tax cut never helped,1
My entire family is Christian and I'm afraid to come out.,1
Rainbow lives matter too,1
That doesn't fit their white man bad agenda. Just like when they murdered several black men in America protesting for black lives.,1
FIRSTnn-never been this early,1
i don't get it they addressing the fact that most geeks are men ? yeah we know that but no one forced women not to become a geek so why all fuss ?,1
@izzles369 I was caught up in that,1

He isn’t a “survivor” his life wasn’t in danger,1
Zackary Shepard TRUTH!!!!!,1
I could be wrong,1
These morons act like they are campaigning to abolish the slave trade. It's protest for protest's sake. They need to study history instead of destroying it,1
@James Garcia HY Pocnsy a noun the parctice of claiming to have moral standards or beliefs to which ones own behavior does not conform pretense OG arrington back to the study with respect,1
@Luke B They were the honoured group before the protest.. fucktard,1
Saying everyone is hungry is pointing out how everyone feels hungry and that unites us. That doesn't mean you stop feeding your daughter. If she's hungry give her food,1
Yeah protestingnnIn Atlanta the BLM protesters shot an 8 year old innocent black girl.,1
this woman is a pioneer and I love her endlessly for all of her work towards helping the LGBTQIA+ community and certainly women,0
All people are not getting killed in the streets like animals. BLM means my live matter too. Its not denying anyone else. Keep following you stupid leader you sound like him.,1
What about you leaving hate comments about someone who doesn’t even know who you are. Don’t you think you’re pathetic?,1
Impressive!nThat's one business leader who didn't steal the idea from others and did something truly useful for the next generation,1
Says it fkin all,1
These people do not even know who this guy was!!!,1
Hai Huynh not true. More whites killed by police.,1
Why all LGBT in this video so denial about that girl opinion. You call people 'homophobic',1
I don't know who the sheriff is but he is wise.,1
Sherriff Clark says the way it is!,1
Whoever boos at the phrase All Lives Matter are truly pathetic.  BLM is as racist as it can get.,1
Who's the 'racists?'  Republicans or Democrap-liberals?  BIG MYSTERY.........,1
@EU infiltrator It's the U.S. police that's the real issue under the control of a right wing extremist racist president. White people are getting hurt too and it all goes on the news. This particular incident was in no way an accident,1
She has old lady voice,1
Paranoia.  People dwell on things in a negative way. We cant change what happened way before we were all born. The statue should be a sign that that kind of acceptability is never to be returned to. Like remembrance day,1
Elise McLeod Well people are taking it like a trend tbh and don’t know what they’re protesting for. Are they protesting for different shops? Because I don’t see how that is going to help Black lives?,1
Whoa  I am saying what s right or wrong but being a police officers trying working long hrs and being in public and dealing with idiots who think they did nothing wrong and don't forget the ones who think they know the law because if you did moron s you would Mr be where you are,1
Nope.nRemoves an opportunity to educate and say never again.nCancel culture is cancelling history.,1
It means a well thought perspective delivered with respect.,1
I'm pretty sure it's the gay guy who committed the hate crime.ncause if I recall the way the progressive stack currently sits is ( Gay < women < Black person ),1
@Hudson Birt choice?-,1
ok so apperently cops are now superior?,1
That's like not agreeing with being black,1
Why is this such a big deal? Where's the outcry for more men to be involved with elementary education?,1
Jimmy Pop She’s not evil half the time. You’re right,1
I bet mlk rolled over in his grave because of this black lives matter protest,1

Trump is for all Americans all that comes from the mainstream media all the Democrats have is the racecar nothing else,1
@Michael Duncan Smells like racism to me,1
@Mauricio Limas It seems that way because the media only reports on black men shot by police,1
You cannot say Juan is liberal nLeftist or mental cretin or race baiter,1
I say all lives matter because I believe racism against any race is wrong.,1
That sheriff is just as right today as he was 4 years ago.,1
Saying all lives matter is not a problem but treating all lives with the same respect is the problem and if that is not happening then it's clear that all lives don't matter you can't go around as a police killing black people and on the other hand arresting white people clearly all lives doesn't  matter,1
That video clip should be posted online under a definition of 'Pandering'.   The Irish guy is the only one who meant what he said.,1
@xPineapple Welcome here's parting gift - Aaron Kasparov Feminism,1

@alan arroyo I know people always claiming things belong to their culture but absolutely ignores that many things they use are from different cultures too if we all will start claiming it they will have nothing.,1

These kids are being raised by parents. I wish more kids were being raised by parents instead of breeders. I'm child free but I'm fine with kids like these. The kid saying..I choose to love was awesome.,0
Statistically a white American Male is more likely to be killed by the police. But yeah only BLM.,1
tom rea Exactly. They are trying to ruin our history. They will have to re write books because of this,1
They haven't shown vandalization of buildings!,1
So. I learned never to get to know people of color because that's offensive to them. Treat them like a dimensionless worker drone. Got it.,1
that would just be uhhhh- pure mean,1
the good old boy Juan Williams is politically sophisticated? really,1
Its not controversial. Its snowflakes crying because it takes the attention away from them,1
Abhijit Sarkar so what? Does that mean it won’t be necessary to pay it any attention?,1

All lives DON’T matter. Plenty of people on this planet deserve to take the room temperature challenge,1
Haiden Alain and that homosexuality was a “choice”,1
Clinically Happy load of rubbish to think it’s just black people that are mistreated in society. White kids smoking meth ain’t a result of race,1

@April Wheeler nThank you for bringing it up nMany people,1
@jimmy sheridan it was wrongly translated. It should say to not lay with a boy (the wrongly translated version says man ) and it refers to pedophilia,0
(Tears in my eyes touched) Wait... I thought that 'boyish' girl was butch?,1
@Sunshine littlephilly I have a question. I’m not lesbian but I have so many friends who are apart of LGBTQ community and I support and honestly would do anything for them,0
Unbelievable this argument even gets off the ground its childish I CAN breathe I CAN stand on 2 feet,1
That is a man.,1
Plantation politics. That’s spot on.,1
Latinos are being held in ICE detention camps,1
Sunshine littlephilly But it also says in the bible Slaves must obey their masters. So you don’t have a problem with slavery? That’s sick.,1

@Dus Bus yea,1
@Jesus is Lord & Savior you are correct sir,1
If you don’t like what someone is saying,1
Black panthers and last poets were anti-gay. So was Malcolm X. nBlack Lives Matter movement is against the nuclear family and they are pro-marxist as they admit this on their website. This isn't a black movement... it's an LGBTQ movement for gays & pro-welfare state agenda disguised as a black movement. nnBLM remained quiet during the shootings on fathers day where over 100 black on black killings took place. The reason they didn't address it is because they didn't want to bring focus to fathers day as it would go against their beliefs.,1
All lives matter you sickening liberals !! Except maybe for the lives of violent criminals,1
...i feel called out,1
Very great speech. I agree that it's cultural,1
Only 1 race,1
Yes sir I went from Democrate to republican because of the idiots on the democratic side vote trump,1
All life is not equally at risk.,1
You are all blind. They are using you as a tool. You've been brainwashed all of you live by the media.OPEN YOU EYES. There are a lot of people from this ETHNICITY,1

I don't agree with homosexualitynLooks like part of the LGBTQ+ community,1
All lives matter. And my race is American! I don’t agree with calling people black American or African American. Get rid of Mexican American,1
@Anna ._. No offense but I don't think LGBTQ+ has any thing to do with personality.,1
Fun fact what will the white blms do at the end suicide?,1
2m They appeared controlled and working as one. No violence,1
no offence but If someone started hitting me with a bible telling me I had to get rid of the devil that was homosexuality I would probably start laughing,1
@JP Morgan agree,1
“God gave us a choice and I chose to love” EXCUSE ME WHILE I GO CRY. THIS KID IS TOO CUTE,0
BLM is a racist hate group and needs to be tried as terrorists,1
I just learned about the cuffed jeans stereotype and i've been doing it for YEARS,1
You people can't just respect her decision of being a Christian can you? Her opinion matters all of a sudden? Just because she doesn't agree with homosexuality? It's not like us Christians go after you for agreeing..so like..stfu,1

He wont say all lives matter...cause hes being paid by the corp affiliated with black lives matter.check his assests and hes more than likely hes on their payroll,1
You have to go down the tree of what the radical left considers 'in' at the moment. Right now I think the sexuality of the black guy would matter. If he was straight,1

It’s having completely the opposite effect,1
@Hi Qwerty bruh u see that she put out facts and u dismiss it by saying oh slot of people hate her so she's lying and btw what evidence do u have to say that she's lying,1
Don't you follow the news? SJWs have disowned gays.,1
You'll get put down for saying all lives matter. Experienced that first hand.,1
If women can go into engineering without being judged,0
Cuffed jeans are fashion statement,1
@Charter Jet Affiliate the police in general do believe that. Don't listen to the news media villify them. A few bad eggs don't make the whole police force dangerous. The police are responsible for keeping civility in this country. The minute they are made a non-factor chaos and anarchy ensues.,1
Remember what Martin Luther King Jr said that every body should be treated equally. So black people can’t even listen to there own race with out even saying BLM. Because if Blacks mattered and whites didn’t then we aren’t treated equally. Cut the BS and help our future crisis for GD!,0
Russia has kept their statues from the Soviet era. More died to the hands of commies,1
Remember what happened to Iraq when they toppled Saddams statue in the same manner.,1
I hate when people say All lives don't matter,1

I met Madonna when she was pregnant for the second time with Rocco. I felt her stomach and I could feel the baby kicking. I also watched as she rubed cocoa butter on her stretch marked pregnant stomach. How do you explain this? LOL you people are crazy.,1

Hope they all die,1
Black* here again,1

I am so glad that Clark No Longer Matters. Black Lives Matter Too  If you are going to allow someone to be at the table you should also allow then to be apart of the same table they are at. . .

Is racism really that bad there? It’s hard to believe that to be honest  it’s not bad here in Canada,1
Yes that is true all lives matter see African American communities are being wrong all race matters everyone has been mistreated no matter what race or gender it has been mistreated by bad cops,1
Repent. God loves the sinner but hates the sin. Don’t believe this creature of Satan. She’s going down and she’ll drag as many as she can with her.,1

@Doc LMAO Liberals to have to fight alongside blacks against the Conservatives to get some semblance of equality  Dude the black are where they are because of Democrats they vote for them like 95%+ of the time,1
BLM gotta check their statistics.... You give them facts,1
Surely the protest should centre on changing legislation that allows police to commit these crimes in the first place,1
I don't! I hate these protesters for ruining decades of progress.,1

BLM is racist organization,1
@pepsi Atlas I'm white and proud of my ancestors and my skin colour!! Does that make me a racist!!?,1
Saying All lives matter can be offensive for the same reason black lives matter can be offensive to some. Black Lives Matter is an offensive saying because to some  it insinuates that the majority of non blacks think that black lives don't matter and that the majority of non blacks are racist when there is absolutely no physical evidence to support that thought. So obviously to a non racist non black that is a grossly offensive notion. Now All Lives Matter can be offensive to some blacks because to them it insinuates that they only care about black lives and that they're saying other lives don't matter when if you actually try comprehend their perspective,0
@Jimmy The Clown,1
@Sweet_Luna Bae shut up snowflake. You don't live in Africa,1
@Khaver Paver The reason you won't go back to Africa is because you would be lost without your white American master giving you handouts in the form of welfare and you'd miss malt liquor and using your race card at every chance you get.,1

@Nataliah Griffin how is Greek Mythology Witchcraft ?,1
People say Black lives Matter becasue it is obvious that many Americans think they don't matter.  The slogan does not day Only Black lives mattter.  Saying all lives matter is a way to avoid saying that Black lives matter.  It has been adopted by racists around the country.  400 years of history (which many refuse to acknowledge) prove that black lives do not matter to many Americans.,1
You see the reason for the saying black lives matter is too raise awareness of how many black people are victims of oppression. A better way to put it is Black Lives Matters Too. So when people say all lives matter it is a true statement but contradicts Black Lives Matter.,1
Look at this offended black boy,1
Mike F. I agree that’s terrible but why doesn’t the African countries do anything about it? I’ll tell you why,1
@Zackary Shepard Idk I'll let you know if I hear any,1
There is good and bad in all races and all professions. All races face discrimination from people who are jerks. There will always be those in the world that do not see the person for the special person that they are. It isn't right. I just have to believe that those who promote hate through discrimination will answer for it when they stand before God.,0

The sad thing is this is the least abusive conversion therapy I've ever heard of. My friends have scars and burns where they were shocked and burned and tortured.

The Catholic priests say otherwise. She's not mother Teresa who actually lived in poverty even though she won 1.5 million with a novel priest prize and really saved lives and souls. Madonna is a woman who lives for herself and had two abortions. nShe's a rich performer with a messed up life and she is not a role model. Take what you can but beware. Eventually she will poison you.,1
Hope is for the ones who love God. Good is evil. Madonna will turn to Christ before she dies and get saved and for this blessing i ask in the holy name of Jesus Christ! Amen.,1

Slavery was a terrible thing to happen. This thing that is happening nis also terrible. A person telling another to get on their knees and apologizenfor the doings of a scather of white people. What percentage of the americannpopulation actually held slaves in 1800? I guarantee you it was less than 50%nprobably less than 40% It was likely less than 20%. One could take the time nand scour the 1800 census to find out. 1810 census,1

Don't they mean that George Floyd was a  Career criminal  That had been arrested 9 times from everything from cocaine drug dealing to  Armed robbery and robbing a pregnant woman at gunpoint and then add trying to buy items with counterfeit money.  If you're being suffocated you can't talk he died of cardiac arrest due to the drugs that were in his system he was a piece of trash That victimized other people. If he wasn't in this country he more than likely would have already had been put to death. If you don't want to be in this country then leave.,1

BLM no longer wants body cameras on police.  Watch a few bodycam police videos and you’ll understand why.  Video after video proves that many of these claims of police brutality are complete bullshit or they are edited without context to spread the anti police narrative by unscrupulous “ social media influencers”. All this does is make it more difficult for the good police who are protecting our streets and people who actually are victims of excessive force.,1

Yes it is controversial to say at this time after this tragedy all lives matter. Yet It's a shame for America to say black lives matter- 2020 still stuck with racism. It means a black life is worth less. If feels bad to hear it. As human specie we have a lot more to learn and need to have some humility. We were just hit by a virus,0
When you listen to conservatives like Rush Limbaugh and Shawn Hannity it blows the lid off socialist anti American 'movements' like BLM!,1

If this is a movement. What is the end goal here? I don't get it.  Bad police need fired and all police need policed. This isn't a white black thing. We all seem to be in agreement that this shit has to stop with the police killing unarmed people. But damn stop the racism toward each,1

@Darryl You were referring to Eagles comment. He mentioned he was starting to dislike black people because of all this then you mentioned it was white people who started it. Either way it is causing serious deviciveness. So if it was white people who started all this do you think there is any good in these people stoking the fires of racism on either side? It's just causing far more racism on both sides because of its devicive nature.,1
Finally someone with common sense!,1

As a species we are inherently tribal by nature. Our society should have reached the status of utopia about 100 years ago but still there's conflict. The issue is us and our primal desire to be in a tribe fighting a cause against our perceived enemies. Once Black Lives Matter is dead and buried the SJW's will join the next trendy thing,1

Wandisa Mlambo check the worldwide blm protests on Wikipedia. Africa had no protests and neither did most of Asia. Do u think countries like Yemen who are in a famine are going to start protesting when their children are starving. Syria actually did support with a small protest. But for the guy to say others are eating popcorn that’s retarded. America eats popcorn while killing civilians in Middle East. That’s petty,1

@kennedy mensah Saying Black Lives Matter implies that most people think that black lives don't matter and that's just insulting.

If that were true than why don't they see that God looks at everyone with pure love and he filled our world with wonders that all people need to experience like the healing power's of all he created. If all lives matter than we will all prosper as it should be. When only one race matters it is doomed to fail because to actually be a true success all lives unite to combat what's wrong.,0
All Lives Matter came as a response to hearing [ONLY] Black Lives Mater when it is meant to be read Black Lives Matter [ALSO]; so saying it is merely a way to show opposition. Using this phrasing of words has been done for some time in modern English,1

Sunshine littlephilly u are saying that he’s a lovely and respectful person why would he go to hell,1
Well I mean if they're truly your friend then you aren't. Racism is rooted in a deep prejudice and hate towards someone of a different race. If you have a hate for someone can you be friends with them? I didn't think so. I have MANY black friends. This makes me.. not racist!! Because if I was truly racist I wouldn't associate with them and keep to my fellow whites. You guys need a dictionary sometimes.,0

Oh and by the way I'm black  hispanic,1
What are they protesting for??  I forget.,1
If these people never came  to Europe they would all been in Africa starving ....and dying why are they creating this trouble here UK  has nothing to do with USA ....... I was not born in the UK been here long before these people if I don’t like the UK that my problem and would go back to my origins ... why can all these people go back to where grandparents came from to see if it’s better...I know why .... because here they have it easy ....what happened in America is terrible I feel for his family Why don’t all these people go to America and do their demonstrations?????? Just go there and leave us alone Both black and white people ....,1

Can i ask a serious question blm is wanting a change but why wont blm got to the continent of Africa and protest in some of the war zone countries,1
Your mind has been indoctrinated into believing your confusion about what is really happening in America. White racism is not your worst enemy.  You have been brought up to believe that from one generation to the next. You will pass it on to the next generation. Black lives Matter is an organized hate group being funded by people outside the US . In London,1
Always been the plan.....thats why they had ID2020 years ago. And were only half way through,1

For the smug twats going on about the value of history,1

All live matter obviously and that Term was set up and put out knowing the racial tension it would cause. George soros was sure of that why he funded the movement from the beginning. Its a game of the people with agendas not necessarily caring about black lives/ police brutality,1

No. Don't bring that cup in here. Those same white people oppressed the natives of South Africa for years. They aren't even true South Africans. They are white colonizers. We are dismantling that system over here,1
That’s not true. Black people just want to be treated by others fairly. At the moment in America,1

“That would just be uh pure mean” omg she’s so sweet,1
Sheriff Clarke nailed it by identifying the LBJ presidency as the starting point of the decline of the black community in America. They happily signed up for Johnson's Great Society and began losing their self-respect by selling their soul to the Democratic Party. It has created generation after generation of an attitude of victim-hood and subsequent dependence on the federal government. The Democratic message is,1

Saddam would of shot these protesters simple as that,1
They basically stood by and did nothing. They were worried about public safety and just writing them up even more than they already were. We’ve all seen how these idiots have been acting right now. It would’ve been unwise to jump into the situation and having the protesters unfairly attacking the police again. They will inevitably though have to get round to fishing it out of the river though.

There are white people in south Africa getting killed every day,1
@Jeremy Stone Agreed. She really should have gotten it first. Bill Clinton certainly did advocate for LGBTQ rights but not until much later. Madonna was doing it long before it was fashionable.,0
Yes thats true,1
Miles Han You guys are way too focused on words. Its not just the term “Black Lives Matter” that pisses people off,1

troyissmexy I don’t care about the words black lives matter.  I just don’t think there is a problem with police officers and blacks. Sure there are cases where cops were very in the wrong but the same stuff happens with every other race.  The difference is that when it happens with any other race it barley appears in the media,1
I had the idea of testing the test - the author simply listed the answers from top to bottom,1
Even the most remote part of our places here when they see Madonna picture or hear her song you can see inspiration and it radiates from her.,0

Sonic Neverslow Clearly you are not getting what I’m saying. She does not agree with their sexuality not EXISTENCE. Sexuality and race are two completely different things. I support the LGBTQ community but I still have a sense and understanding that not everyone supports it. But as long as they respect those people and are kind,0
@GTC that's Madonna not Whitney.,1

This is a watershed moment for me too since I'm starting to conclude to my absolute shock and horror that we fought on the wrong side in World War II.,1
The true racists are Obama and the democrat politicians get this the white politicians and Obama are related look it up and then ask again why is mixed race obama who is both races hating on whites  because white democrats politicians told the idiot to start a race war Obama’s not the brightest bulb in his democratic family that’s why he’s ordered to start a race war he’s owned you can see it.,1

@On The Far Right Republicans try to stop blacks from voting by making a big deal of voter fraud which just isn't a big deal but means the poor can't afford to vote.nRepublicans try to get rid of groups like planned parenthood that help the poor.nRepublicans fight against raising the minimum wage which would mean the few jobs black people can get pay enough to live on.nRepublicans are against any kind of social benefits to top up the income of those who are on minimum wage.nFor most of American history the economy and job availability has grown far more under Liberal rule.n,1

Who said it was controversial to say??? There's nothing wrong with saying that. The only reason that Black groups went out with signs that said Black lives matter at those anti police brutality protest rallies,1

Because All lives matter isn’t used as a push for all lives actually mattering they are simply anti BLM and it isn’t black vs white we know this. It’s against the police system that fucks blacks in the ass and has been for generations. The reason why we say BLM is because cops kill blacks and get out scot free as if their lives don’t matter. nnnnIt’s not blacks against whitesnIt’s about fixing the racist police,1

2000tc88 i think you should definitely read into what the phrase black lives matter really means. i feel like a lot of people are misinterpreting it. obviously all lives matter but currently black lives are not being treated as equals. maybe you see past a person’s skin color but so many people in this world don’t. the goal is for black lives to be treated equal,1
it’s pretty easy to survive something that isn’t fatal,1

@TheCounterpointer Funny. Typical misogynist. You say feminists are stupid for thinking there's discrimination against women in stem fields just because women make up such minority but then use the same statistics to make a point how women being minority in some fields means they're biologically inferior or not capable of doing something and you just assume men are better at everything.So hilarious and sexist,0

Police brutality that's a joke. Especially when more white people are killed by cops than blacks. Most blacks are killed by their own but nobody says anything about that. That just shot the hell your idea of police brutality. Just more idiots following the blind agenda. Floyd was nothing more than a drugged-up criminal.,1

I think this is so biased hiho. Honestly way too biased to be represented in this way to kids. Not fair. nWhat he said ‘“religious people don’t like gays” is so wrong. The people who believe in the God of the Bible love Gods creation. We love gays just as much as any sinner. We believe it is one of the many sins that seperate us from God.,0

They were told leave the statues. They hold different meaning and values about history. We cannot keep thinking it's all about race. It's over the top of reason and doubt. The truth will be told about plans schemes regulators a d who wants to without outwardly saying so. It's looking more like history wasn't kept right. Not really...we don't go away. General Lee is part of history. Now they are charged with destruction of property and lueting. By lies. You'd wanted so much more. It wasn't to start anytime sweety.,1

Smokeed  although for what I don’t get at the same time believe me before it was that one rogue cop that did something to George Floyd George Floyd was actually a criminal before all of this news coverage and got arrested a couple of times before the media covered him I mean all lives matter is saying it in equality that all lives matter this means black white everyone not in a deserve to live or die that I decided by the justice system if they committed crime but everyone has the same rights in this great nation even black conservatives don’t like the BLM movement for it does not even help the real black community but sometimes the opposite,1

just because a prosperous country for SOME was founded and profited off the exploitation of others doesn't make it right. the UK was established from Christianity but a lot of people aren't Christian. civilisation was established with a lot of things that do not represent what our views can and should be in the 21st century so your point is flawed my friend.,1

I know  there is some sexism in the workforce and there is no doubt about that. But the thing that i hate is that these people are basically saying with all these stupid percentages that men need to change and help women into engineering and men are the problem that there aren't really any women in that field. And that is completely wrong the main reason that there aren't any women in engineering is because women just don't choose to go into that line of work. it's as simple as that.,0

Only racist people get pissed off about someone saying All Lives Matter.,1
All lives matter offends black supremacists who salute with their right hand and insist other ethnicities kneel before them. nnSurprised America has allowed it to go this far. Europe won’t because we can still remember the last time fascists tried to take away our rights and freedoms by imposing their narrow views onto society.nnWoke is an extremist movement which is vastly unpopular amongst the masses,1
Its not. God that was simple.,1
@Chinskins TronI feel sorry for all of you for not following God's word. I am a good person,1
That sheriff is 100% right and it’s starts in the home...the family unit. Apart from hannity he’s the only one that makes sense,1
Black lives matter always,1
It would have been nice. I'm a female engineer but no work will take me in! So,0
@Jake Riviera the house for BLM is already burning... You don't stop the people trying to save the burning house by saying all houses matter. You save it.,1
I agree but that's only some and I think most mean to use in the the meaning and text I explained it's not always the one you explained and that can be a misunderstanding when people assume that that was their intentions,1
I took that quiz and it put me at 2.5 hostile sexist. BUT i took it again and put female as my gender instead for the same answers and I got 2.17 hostile sexist. Fantastic,1

All these things are happening under parental control (or the lack of it). Don't blame it on the system or any one political party or persuasion. This is a democracy and therefore it's possible to effect changes at the stroke of a pen,1

Yes...I love this officer!,1
@*****nWhat I am is someone who first and foremost realizes how LONG it took to get to where we are today,1
A lot of you are writing how that girl is going to suddenly realise like you did that she isnt straight etc etc because of the way shes dressed and stuff but regardless if thats true or not its rarely easy to come to terms with your sexuality especially if youve been raised to be against it. People saying this about her is most likely going to make her feel uncomfortable and upset. And while yes that isnt something someone should be feeling towards the LGBT community its likely the mental state shes is so like leave it lads,0
Salimah K plus that took you 3 weeks to come up with that? You’re slow.,1

@Jack HoopernThey're being a smart arse.nnThey are Hillary supporters. And what does Clinton represent? Feminism.nnmelev30 wants to see a Feminist as President. Because they cheer for Feminism.nnShe's going to mess it up.nnHow do I know?nnBecause incompetent women are often Feminists who scream misogyny! or sexism! when their competence is in question OR when they need to politically cover their screw-ups.nnThis is what Australia experienced with former Prime Minister Julia Gillard. Look her up. A complete incompetent Feminist who pulled the gender card during the dying days of her Govt. She literally jump the shark trying to emulate Obama with her Women for Gillard campaign. She was thrown out by her own party BEFORE Australian people could vote her out.nnHave a good look at how Clinton handled being Secretary of State. Note how her campaign advisers keep her away from interviews where the media may ask hard questions of her. (Because she always messes those up!) ...She doesn't have the charisma or the political skill of her husband.nnIn fact,1

Its time to call these protests and riots for what they have become.nA far left socialist uprising. nnThis was never simply about so called police brutality and systemic racism. nGroups like Antifa are pushing an agenda which threatens the stability and prosperity of our society. nDo not forget these are the people that follow an ideology which has impoverished and killed many millions of people in Communist/Socialist controlled societies around the world over the last century. nUltimately they do not serve the best interests of the poor. They simply hate the rich.nGiven the opportunity they will not think twice about turning their Nations into failed welfare States in order to achieve their objectives. nnIt's time to call them out,1

+Jonathan Mason I could also agree on one thing agree to disagree because no matter how many ways someone says something I'm always going to think all lives matter because we're all lives matter means is you matter other personal matters the world matters nobody should be treated like they don't matter when it comes down to it it's all about ethics In fairness at the end of the day isn't that racisms weakness let me tell you this it's not just about me it's about everyone including yourself you should have a right be treated fairly and I don't have anything against you just saying I believe the answer to getting rid of racism fairness caring about everyone no matter what their color is everybody's life matters including you I care about even what's fair your side my side their side because I don't like racism I rather be a solution to the problem then sit there and tell people but only my life matters when in reality that's a bunch of baloney it doesn't matter what color you are your life matters and you're important as anybody else how could that be a bad thing,0

most of them won't because of criminal background. im talking about all nationality's here. there is police brutality but it ain't nearly as bad as people make it out to be. they should be held accountable for wrongful actions but then there are even video's of activist dealing with police training scenario's and they shoot just as fast. it's hypocrisy.,1
Ik I thought she would get emotional because they would be able to relate.... but then again sometimes it takes a long time to come to terms with the “weird” feelings you feel so she may be repressing them... there’s a lot of discomfort on her face throughout the video and honestly I think she fears someone is going to “drag her out of the closet”. Growing up I dealt with that same kind of fear not because my family wouldn’t accept me because I knew they would but I was scared I wouldn’t accept me... idek if that made sense but overall she could just be fighting this internal battle that her true self hasn’t fully won yet,0

Slavery existed in Africa thousands of years before any white man set foot on its shore but in American schools the only slavery you are taught about is the transatlantic slave trade. About every ethnicity that exist was at one time involved in slavery. In America this is the generation of entitlement and victimhood. The crown of victimhood is worn with great pride by those who never experienced any form of slavery,1
@gamerxj To many people Chinese lives don't matter either after Cov-19. Is it any better to say Chinese lives matter?

God loves everyone,0
I’m a Christian but I agree and support homosexuality and the LGBTQ community. I understand that everyone is different and is free to believe in what they want but if you are against homosexuality because of the bible then simply think of how God would much prefer you to spread kindness than hate. At the end of the day if you don’t agree with it then simply keep it to yourself and think before you spread hate! ‍,0

White Lives Matter! White lives have been depreciated throughout decades. Whites are called racists because of skin color. Who wants to start a movement and march? We will accept all nationalities that will help honor white color. Don’t cause a white out! White privilege matters!!,1

@night light   The Egyptian indigenous are Not the Egyptian of today . The true ancient Egypt is a tribal called Nubian. They're still largely present in the southern Egyptian  valley.  They're black basically as Egypt is already geographical located in African. Morocco. Tunisia.algeria and Libya were all black once upon a time. However they're still black citizens  in those countries  but live in countrysides. Modern Egyptian falsified the Egyptian history of nubian but many know the fact. Go to Google and time Nubian.,1
why the black not go back to the african continent,1
Well probably because the parents do want kids to go crazy so its become a rule. And ive seen in other Kids meet a *blank* the parents be pulled up. She may've been scared,1

No they should not be removed. The meaning of the statues will have changed over the generations. Some like the one pulled down represented orginally the good he did for Bristol. The statue became known more recently as  a sign of repression. Now the statue has gone the struggle will have been forgotten. The statue had served a purpose.,1
Ashton Levry I get what you're saying but at the same time why should they defend people that we say all lives matter if we're all created equal shouldn't there be all right for us to say all lives matter because honestly I think we do matter we all matter but even if you're what you're saying is true then it shouldn't hurt your feelings that we say all lives matter no offense,0

+Clorox Bleach nPutting aside all the Alex Jones type shit,1
Haitch Smith but to say you won’t say black lives matter because you were bullied as a kid is ludicrous. You’re condemning an entire racial group just because a few black kids bullied you. I’m sure they weren’t the greatest people but that’s to say everyone in your racial group are evil and should be punished accordingly. Makes no sense,1
Police are gutless. Hampered by years of Political correctness. They need to get the batons out and get on top of these thugs. Can't believe they stood back and watched this happen. Pathetic.,1

@Gregory Smith “Erected by citizens of Bristol as a memorial of one of the most virtuous and wise sons of their city.” that was the plaque under the statue no mention of the slave trading or the people who died it wasn't their to educate it was yes their to commemorate which is defined as marking showing respect or celebrating.,1

@Simon Yip yeah abolition was passed in 1807 by the british who then went through great lengths to abolish slavery against the wishes of africa who's main export was slaves. The UK was amongst the first nations to abolish it and they incurred such a massive debt fighting it that they still had debt from it up until a decade ago. So yeah england had slavery,1

@Drew Saluk It doesn't say that. The Bible already gives extramarital affairs the thumbs-down elsewhere. There's no need to mention the homosexual angle if that were the case.

the liberal promise of autonomy is empty,1

@GamerXP3 the minute you mention white privilege is the minute your credibility dies. That's an ad hominem attack to demean white people and make our accomplishments essentially worthless. It's an excuse. A fallacy. The black community won't change until they take responsibility for their own actions. The community wont change until they stop blaming white people for all of their problems. I don't want to hear about privilege coming from minorities considering they get to live illegally here and get hand outs because they don't want to work. It's a logical fallacy.,1

How are you going to cure someone by hitting them and make them repeat the same thing over and over again on a daily basis ? This is no therapy. There's nothing therapeutic in being hurt or brainwashed. How do we still call those... things therapies ? This is nothing more than legal abuse. Parents who send their child there would say i'm sending my child in a place where they will be abused both mentally and physically if they were honest about themselves.

@Molly Rebekah You don't know what I know about the Bible or religion in general. Paul never met Jesus and if Jesus ever wanted to say anything about homosexuality he could said it himself if it was important. Through his own teachings and even his sermon on the mount Jesus spoke about many topics. Homosexuality was never a topic. The closest he ever got to speaking on sexuality was with his discussion about marriage where he talked about Eunuchs in Matthew 19,1
If you're black you can say white lives doesn't matter and nobody will say anything and it is not considered racist but if a white says all lives matter it's racism..... I don't get today's society I really don't. And yes ALL LIVES MATTER.,1

Why doesn't Black Lives Matter protest the wars. 57 percent of the U.S. federal budget wasted on the military. That is what Martin Luther King protested and today the industrial military is far more extreme. Kids in the U.S. are forced to join the military out of desperation which is a form of economic slavery. This extreme hording of Tax dollars is why their is a lack of funding for social services,1

Ok...here it goes folks...OF COURSE ALL LIVES MATTER. What idiots don't get is that when people started saying Black Lives Matter THEY WEREN'T SAYING THAT ALL OTHER LIVES DON'T! Some idiots got offended that people started saying Black Lives Matter so they started saying no...all lives matter to sooth their hurt egos. Some folks are tired of being discriminated against solely because of their color. When people experience systematic racism,1

First day of sophomore I walked into my first period. I walked in it,1
Just letting y’all know god never said he dosent agree with homosexuality. If your going to the Bible it’s says “a man who shall lay with a woman shall no do with a man” but that part is mistranslated. Man was actually Boy which is referring to pedos. Also you gotta kinda remember the Bible was not written by god it was written by men who claimed to have met god. I’m not going against religion I’m just saying the truth if you still don’t believe in it that’s fine because it’s your opinion but I’m just throwing all this out there,1
Jesus Christ will tell you,1
I hate people who smile all the time,1

+J Brown I meant to say I don't care who Boos me because I know at the end of day I'm right it's also pretty hypocritical people sit there and complain about racism but they turn around at the exact same way our lives only matter blah blah blah all lives the way I see it racism is black and white either you think that you are better than that person because you are that color you are racist or you think there's no difference between that person whether they're that color or not and you are not racist so what do you think about that the only way for racism the stop is when all lives matter but you know what I think people are too proud to admit it so therefore racism will never ever ever end because people actually boo the people that make sense because it doesn't go with their beliefs you either believe that their lives matter and yours doesn't or you're a racist but in reality they're actually the ones being racist,0

If I had to pick which is more feminist I would say the exposing American Feminism is more accurate than the 'modest' Muslim Feminism.

So there is no other choice but agree to say black lives matter in less you want to be labeled as a bad person.🤔  You want people to support a movement that agrees with a organization that the person is against 🤔. I'm not white but I have to say All Lives Matter even the ones that BLM doesn't support.,0

@Insidious I thought it was Pelosi,1
I actually agree with her when she said it’s a cultural problem. There are countries where girls have a hard time being in STEM  and countries where they are mostly completely fine. I personally grew up going to a math and physics based lyceum that was super hard to get into and we had about 5 or 6 boys  in a class of 30 people. We had a blast and our gender  was never an issue. I don’t know if it would be the same if we weren’t a majority but all the girls went on to become engineers,0
How dumb can these protesters be,1
I am currently looking for conversion therapy. I'm not a pusspuss like this guy. If anyone could give me some info I'd appreciate it. Have fun person in the video with your fear mongering.,1
Shayotita I understand and have seen this response plenty of times. Those crimes unfortunately are often only brought up in mainstream media as a counter point which I find disheartening. In my town meetings and day to day conversations it’s a prominent topic. I agree that it must absolutely be addressed more and dealt with. I suppose news outlets don’t find the topic profitable so it’s left out only to be used in a divisive manner.,1

How can you be  surprised that people are surprised that you are an engineer in the same video that unbiased shows that only 10% of engineers are females?nnThat means that your colleges are right to ask you if you are one of those mythological unicorns. There is literally 90% chance you're not.nnAlso you want more female engineers? Good. Me too. Society too. Don't preach to men how they're not reacting well to you on the off chance you are an engineer. Preach to young girls how engineering is cool,0
​@Everything EVERYTHING!! Ironic how black people had encouraged the slave trade during it's golden ages.

Aside from all the stereotypes,1
Here's my question. Why do black or most black people hate All Lives Matter? Could it be that black folks in america don't give a crap about any other race but their own? Wasn't the black people from Africa the real slave owners and slave traders of their own kind? Do they ever protest if the cop was black instead of white or some other race?,1

Yes it is ok to not agree with the political views of the movement. But you do not have to donate directly to them. There are other organizations related to the movement of black lives matter,1

I used to live in a shared house with a family who would take in foreign students. One student was from Saudi Arabia and he was amazed that women were allowed to walk around with no hijab on. A female student asked him to go for a drink and he actually went back to the family he was staying with and asked them Is this allowed in your country? Is this OK? because it's not allowed in Saudi Arabia. So you can't possibly equate Islam to feminism.,1

@Soul-Ring Games It doesn't matter if she didn't say it literally. She implied that just because it happened to her it might happen to Annie (which might literally not happen). People have to just respect her opinion and I can see a lot of people here don't.,1
So is your face! That's why you don't have a profile picture.,1
My opinion...Black LIves Matter is both a phrase as well as a political organization founded by three community activists with a socialist agenda. When you say black lives matter you may believe you are simply supporting a slogan but you are also empowering the leftest organization of that name. According to White House records the organizers were coordinating and meeting with the Obama Administration in the aftermath of Ferguson as the group was being founded and are closely aligned with the Democratic Party. It is clever strategy to use what sounds like a well meaning slogan as the name for a political organization with a much larger agenda.,1

This Sheriff Clarke knew the genesis of black people's problems in US. It's in destruction of their family lives and in liberal ideologies. That was the beginning of their problems.

@Abrams Lion The only people shaking in fear over BLM protests are corrupts cops and white supremacists.  Decent people everywhere are cheering.,1
@jazzfan1 Are you really going to tell me that white privilege takes the same form in Oregon as it does in Louisiana? Are you really that disconnected from reality? White privilege is not a blanket concept that works the same way everywhere the way you and the rest of BLM want to make it seem. If you can't even narrow in on what institutions are actually causing problems then you have no hope of ever fixing them.,1
@Pratibha Shetty yes great one I no what it takes to be an engineer......I am also a female mechanical engineering,0

A.J Mulenga That is totally twisting words and meanings. Saying all lives matter is controversial,1
I think it's very hurtful that it's like saying we don't think black lives matter.  Someone in another country does an atrosity and we end up with people crowding our local town scaring people and spreading the virus and potentially killing people by doing so.  It's like pent up lock down syndrome... . Please think of other ways to show us your views. I am white and might not get exactly what you mean or misunderstand. How about having an mp who just does black rights  in the uk.  The NHS etc have enough to do right now with riaki g there lives against the virs... Which includes black and white staff at risk.,1
@MICHAEL RAMPHISA of course. The mfkene was white instigated. Anyway I agree. Let all whites back into Europe and the blacks in the UK can go to SA.,1
Tommy Qreusse nI don't quite agree.  Racism is not being pushed.  I think that the ideal of racial equality under the law stands firm.   This has sound basis in the Word of God,1

hans kasper No one ever said white lives doesn’t matter. Why don’t white Americans start their own protest instead of trying to forcefully join and switch the agenda. In no way is it a double standard,1
@Xx Rose_petals Xx it's still legal in much of America. That's why we continue to protest.,1
I would fire each one of these woman anybody who whines and complains like this needs to be fired you will make excuses every time crap doesn't go your way everyone has to prove themselves in engineering and a lot of feels like that because you do not get a free pass just because you've had success you have to prove yourself each time that goes for men older people younger people woman groups and individuals anyone can fall out of favor and anyone can succeed over others if people look at you a certain way when you walk in a room probably because you are a big whiny complainer and they know they're going to have to deal with your BS constantly whining about this and that that has nothing to do with the work if affirmative action was gone tomorrow these people would be the first on the chopping block they make office spaces work environments and team groups in hospitable towards each other because everyone has to step around eggshells with them end of demoralizing the and the whole office atmosphere,1

@Ashxr it never said u should hate the person its that it's hard for a Christian for example to be able to accept homosexuality when we have been taught to have heterosexual relationships.  In addition we are also taught to love because if that's their option then so be it if u don't understand my explanation u could ask me to rephrase it God bless,1

Eugene Birukov when injustice happens to another race we’ll do the same thing. Why do you think there’s a ton of lgbt people supporting the BLM? Because black people supported them when the lgbt community were fighting for their rights. Why do you think us Hispanics part of the BLM because black people helped us when that disgusting punk called trump put CHILDREN IN CAGES. We’re all equal but racist cops don’t understand that. That’s the whole point of black lives matter.,1

When people say all lives matters its derogatory to the black lives movement this movement stand for the political injustice that black people face just walking down the streets dresses in a suspicious manner. So when you say all lives matter you make it as though all lives face this same issue. Naturally all lives matter is that even a question. But the problem here is when you say all lives matter you indirectly denounce the problems faced by victims of racist police brutality by also indirectly implying that all lives face this problem,1

It's the cops that are doing it not an entire  RACE! Why dont you bring up any other race. not just white people are the problem. And that's why BLM is racist because its attacking an entire race. Yes some cops are being a**holes that are white,1

Here is how I feel about it. I recently saw a video of Zendaya and a interviewer. They asked her a question about BLM. This is what she said... All lives do matter...but the ones we need to focus on are the black lives. And she is 100% correct. All lives do matter. But I agree that the ones we need to focus on are Black lives.,1

The use of black live matter does not mean other lives don't matter. That's not at all the point of the phrase. It's like when the save the sea turtles movement was popular a while back. Just because people want to save the sea turtles doesn't mean that all other fish are irrelevant and don't matter. They simply believe that turtles being endangered is something that needs attention,1

@Buster Boo Destroying innocent peoples lives is absolutely wrong! The people I support in this movement are those who are peacefully highlighting the need for change in the police system,1
Liberals are for inclusion but including all lives matter is somehow.......non inclusive???  What??,1
Thanks for sharing.,1
Why are people soooo pressed about a slave traders statue being dumped into a river??,1
Nice to see young people out in 5he fresh air getting exercise ..that statue was a crap idea 120 years ago  Britain stood against slavery along with Napolean,1
Not to mention just a downright lie,1

These Drive-By forums are not worth a whole lot...all make some valid points,1
Jens “it seems racist”....you have many people just in this comment section alone claiming it is racist. Whether you agree with them or not there are people offended by it. Now you’re telling me it’s deliberate and designed to be provocative to get people talking...you can’t see the hypocrisy here? nI get they want to be heard and feel like they haven’t been treated as equals but the message should always be equality. It should always be about bringing everyone together and making them realise we are all the same regardless of skin colour. Nobody should be made to feel racially attacked or victimised in a movement to stop that very thing happening. n“So why should they pander to white comfort and preach a slogan that keeps white people in that comfort space” again it’s comments like this that implies all white people are the problem here which simply isn’t true. You can’t fight racism while attacking an entire group of people based on their skin colour,1
pretty much all countries in the world,1
jzizzles that’s not true AT all…,1

Someone says all lives matter and people say you don't get it. But I think THEY are the ones who don't get it. People who say All lives matter are trying to discourage the mindset that race matters at all. Instead of focusing on the race of people,1

@Xeno People of Bristol were petitioning for years to remove the statue. It belongs to the people of the city after all.

what hapend to covid 19 ???,1
The sheriff is right ! The welfare system was not inacted to help. But inacted to hold down,1
George floyd was a bad guy. He robbed a pregnant woman at gun point and did five years prison for it and people are making a movement over this guy. He held a gun to a pregnant woman's stomach and beat her so him and his friend could steal her money and mobile phone. Real role model. Look it up,1

@Sister Sidney the reason the civil rights movement was so powerful was because people were protesting like civilized people not running around lighting stuff on fire acting like fools. That why this is a joke. Black lives do matter for sure I'm all for that statement but people are saying black lives matter but are using the statement to do ignorant things. Maybe it would be taken more serious if people acted like adults and not children.,1

This is just wrong. This is your perceived notion of what white people think. Your average everyday white person isn't out to demean and diminish minorities. It's what the news media has told you they do but it's simply not true.,1

Y'all act like you are so woke in the comments but are reinforcing the stereotypical archetype of a lesbian by saying Annie looks like one. You cannot tell someone's sexuality by their appearance. All masculine girls are not lesbians and if you walked up to an actual lesbian and told them they look like they like girls they'd probably be offended. The irony of attacking someone for homophobia while being homophobic yourself.,1

Why are they even protesting? They should mind their own business. Their not George. You know it's happening more to whites. But they don't care. No mention of the white cop that died the same way bc democrats use this to gain votes media pushing an agenda . Not one of them there would know what racism was if it but them on the hind in. If one thing happens they think it's happened to them all. We forget about white slaves. And even though some confederate generals fought to abolish slavery. Democrats do not like facts. They want paw patrol gone,1

it is controversial to say 'all lives matter' because a large portion of the black community demand they be pandered to and they don't give a crap about anyone but themselves; they also don't want to take any accountability for their actions and feel entitled to things they never worked for or earned; let me know if i'm leaving anything out...,1

Ill be honest this speech did not inspire me. She made it seem like they don't encourage women to do well in engineering. As a Chemical Engineering student I have been nothing but supported by teachers and other classmates in my program to succeed and do well. The STEM field wants more women in the field... women just don't choose to be in the field. The majority of women want to be in other careers like teaching or business. Most of the girls that I have talked to ask me why I would want to be into a major like this. It's not a problem of women not being encouraged to be in engineering,0

@Jessica Walker oh my god...like common...im religious..but im pretty sure that some books in the bible were lost....and most of them were books of women...second of bible has been translated into different languages which may cause errors and misunderstandings.....ik ur have ur own opinion..but telling a person there love for a person of their own gender...which they were born with just like straight people...is a sin because its gods words. I think god would rather accept the people who show love to everyone and dont think that something a person is born with is a sin or crime. Just saying. Just love everyone who isnt anyone.,1
@Serhiy Vereshchak statistics say the opposite...,1
Jessica Walker - “not agreeing” still isn’t the right context. Not LIKING makes more sense. When you say you don’t “agree” with something it’s as if you’re responding to someone who wants your permission or is asking for your permission to be themselves. You not liking something because of the hate that’s been imbedded inside you via a book where a man walks on water and snakes talk is YOUR personal issue.,0
Most white people just will never be able to understand why black people do what they do.nnI don't if it is due to a lack of empathy or they just don't care.,1

Yes all livea matter but right now were talking about a group of americans thats leading cause of dearh is law  enforcement and its wrong to discount whats happening everyday by trying to divide a country trying to save and validate minority group in america and save lives.,1

tedmccarron Okay. Have all your family taken away from you. Don’t eat in weeks. Be beaten and scared for life as a child. Imagine having a child. You loved him/her with all your heart and you would do anything show your love as a father/mother. How could you even think twice about sending them away for loving somebody?

its all lives matter to say black lives matter is racist. racism does know color to begin with. recently if ppl look on utube. a black cop beat up a Hispanic guy that couldnt speak english. it is the reverse racism in the country. white cops are considered racist rite off the bat. but does the music industry do anything about in hip hop song the use of the N word no but if it was a white rapper then it would be racist.,1

There was no All lives matter movement before the Black lives matter movement. Saying all lives matter exists with the sole function of being a counter argument or distraction to civil rights issues. Obviously the police and a large percentage of white people do not actually believe that all lives matter. All lives matter quite specifically exists and ONLY exists to oppose the statement that black people matter. How is this hard to comprehend?

If this conlon guy was actually a slave trader then i ncompletely support removing the statue. I only have 1 problem with this video. Which is the protestors dumping the statue at the bottom of a habour. Thus making bristol seem like a kip full of hoodlums who dont care about their areas appearance. Not to mention their environment as a whole. If they really wanted to make a point then they should've just found a way to bring the statue down to the city council and leave it outside.,1

Black Lives Matter only before a presidential election. After elections are over you won't hear of it again till the next election 4 years from now.

You are fools. The constitution says all men are equal but was that true. The constitution had to change over generations to free the slaves and then with civil rights laws. If all lives matter why are amendments needed? All lives donot matter.,1
I agree,1
I think we should collectively agree to not label this as therapy. This is not therapeutic at all. This is abuse. Covering it up with a medical term when its not even medical in nature  (hitting someone with a book is physical abuse/repeating verses meant to break your will for hours a day is mental abuse) is disrespectful to the field of medicine which serves to help and cure people. Gayness does not to be cured. It is not a disease. It is not a choice. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Now lets respect one another and help stop this abuse.,0
Only lives that matter are GOOD PEOPLE'S.  WINNERS NOT LOSERS!!!,1

@dragonflywhisp Checked off a while ago? What bubble are you living in? LGBT people get attacked publicly at twice the rate any other American minority group does; it's gotten much worse than it was ten years ago. And this is ONLY American statistics. There are countless countries where it's punishable by prison or death.nThere's a fine line between being a professional victim and sticking your head in the sand and pretending all the bad things are over now. Although I know that's what a lot of people want to do. The gays got that one thing,1
probably bad marketing,1
Coming is terrifying cause you don’t know how they’ll react,1

For sure. i can almost guarantee this year will be taught in history classes,1
@SCIIMiwabl you don't think it's coincidence at all that George floyed was black and the cop was white that all the proof you have though a white man killed a black man that's not racist yes it's wrong but who the hell said it was racist he was not screaming racial slurs while kneeling into his neck tbh we will never know if it was racist or not,1
Black matter live what ever we are is strong dont kill black people,1
How many racist people are here I can’t believe it,1

I just do not understand why people don't realize that she's a top witch Satanist and all of her videos and everything and so much of what she does totally is obvious and prove that and she's just part of the new world order to brainwash people for the agenda for the transgender agenda for all that stuff cuz she actually is transgender and people need to do their research cuz her recent show she just did was completely Satanist New World Order shows the end time stuff and people really need to watch who they worship and look up to because people worship this woman and she's a Satan worshipper,1
She lost me at her claim about engineers ...solving things like global warming...nKind of difficult to solve a problem that occurs naturally in the cosmos.,1
perhaps it is controversial because it misses the point when another black person is killed over something very minor by the police. if they were to protest with signs saying all lives matter,1

I dont understand why it is up to anyone else but yourself to make the decision to become an engineer or whatever. The great thing about america or any other nation that is similar is that if you work hard you can accomplish pretty much anything you set your mind to. Obviously you need to network and some luck but saying you need to get more diversity just to get more diversity is absurd. I dont care who the engineer that helps make my bridge,0

@Astute Cingulus it's what's happening today why I don't support BLM. They make it all about skin color. At first it starts peaceful but then there's destruction and nothing but pointing fingers. Google Tony Timpa. He was a innocent schizophrenic white man calling the police for help. White officers killed him. Because it was white on white you didn't see it everywhere you go. Not even on the news.,1
I noticed that within engineering schools,1
That melted my heart.,1
@Taylor Bridges  Hey Dummy Maria Botina was a Russian agent that infiltrated the NRA. She laundered millions to Trump and she went to prison.nnSo is it illegal for BLM to support Democrats. If so lock them up the way Giuliani's boys Lev Parnas and Igore Fruman were arrested for laundering Russian cash to Trump and other Republicans. Oh I forgot FOX didn't want you to know that. nnOh you might want to know the Trump Foundation was shut down by regulators. Trump was using the money for himself.

Where did the Sheriff go?? We need him back...🤷‍,1
BLM was founded as a reaction to UNPUNISHED police abuses and historic targeting and escalation of force used on black and brown people. nAll Lives Matter is a 'what about' red herring fallacy to deflect to conversation away from the complaint. If you 'what about' an argument,1

I wanna be an engineer but I suck at math. But I like chemistry and physics...,0
My own personal view of this is the statue was a reminder of what should not of happened in history ... so should of been left as an embarrassing reminder.  Also the obvious many people there in the crowds are going to catch covid and maybe die ..... so not only will they get ill or die but some poor NHS worker (from whatever ethnic background) will have to look after them and risk there own life doing so ...,1
shut up he an industry plant! stay woke,1
@kris c sin? Gurllllll. Everyone sins,1
Just look at what is happening now,1
@mya kahlo hahaha your whole argument fell apart. You can't hold BLM accountable for what some protesters say in the heat of a protest. The Dallas shootings were an isolated incident. The BLM does not condone violence nor does it hate police officers. nice to see you've admitted you're against it when you've been dismissing it the whole time. Also your profile picture and linked google account shows you're a white male so I have trouble believing anything you say at all. Nice to see you also like to victim blame and that basically black people should just deal with racism because the world is not out to get them when it so blatantly is. Colorblind racism at its finest.nnKeep liking your own comments though. It probably makes you feel better.,1
I feel bad for laughing about him getting beaten by a bible,1
@*Vibes in queer* You can't be a lesbian and a Christian at the same time. It's contradictory. I'm sure you read all the comments I did before this one. But whatever yoi believe. 🤷‍,1

It's good to see a comment like this here. I hope there will be more 'meet half way' comments in the future.,1
I saw a guy making a jet engine. or a mad scientist with a new type of something unlimited power. lol,1
What still shocks me is that Democrats like Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden use black culture constantly for votes and recognition. Nancy wore a traditional African tribal scarf to “relate and stand with the BLM movement” even though Africa has absolutely nothing to do with the BLM movement or American system,1

Man I’m black and I disagree with black lives matter. But I think all lives matter man.,1
@Molly Rebekah You mean disapprove with acts of homosexuality. Homosexuals exists,1
Its amazing that this video is from 2016 and look how history repeats itself. Its almost like these are not organic movements but political puppets brought out only when an election year happens too stoke conflict and division. Go look at who funds BLM. George Soros and now even China is backing them with millions of dollars which gets funneled through Actblue and goes straight too fund DNC candidiates.,1
@James Johnson Sorry. Even though I agree with you,1
Your lives already matter stfu,1

Tenacious Tacosnthere tends to be this antagonism towards women stating their point of view because it is automatically viewed as misandrist and discriminatory against men when paradigms like sexism and racism are not symmetrical because of the historical precedents where one group has been favored more than another. These scholarship initiatives are merely attempts to balance an unbalanced game. Not to take from opportunities that were already there- supplement not supplant. There's enough to go around,0
Search up racism please. I'm convinced people just like to to throw the word 'racist' around as soon as it's black people.,1

I find it funny at the amount of attention the lack of female engineers gets while ignoring that females are outperforming males in every aspect of school BESIDES engineering.

This is 100% true. But your oppinion cannot change the fact that the world has a race problem. You can choose to ignore it but it's there. All lives cannot matter until black lives matter. It is not possible for all lives to matter if we/other races keep on blowing up innocent black people.,1

So human lives matter would be a good slogan to fight for.,0
No you’re missing the point. When a black life is taking there is no consequence to the police. When a white man takes a white man’s life the life matters when a black man takes a black male life the wife matters when an agent man takes an Asian man life the life matters. But when you have cops killing black people regularly on camera and getting away with it. You tend to believe black lives don’t matter. Because if it was white people in those situations it would never have had happened. So then you have to ask yourself do black lives matter to the American government and the judicial system. The answer is no! Do all lives matter yes of course that’s been established. Now let’s talk about the lies that are being taken by the people who are supposed to protect us. Stop avoiding the point. I can’t even believe they talking about in all lives matter debate versus a black lives matter debate. The day you see all lies being treated the way black people has been treated then we will have it all lives matter debate.,1

The whole Hands Up,1
Saying “All Lives Matter” was created to subdue “Black Lives Matter”,1
So much irony. So little intelligence abound from each side.,1
Pretty sure they're misattributing a good chunk of perceived offences to sexism. People can dislike each other over so many things,1

well then good job boys we now have recreate history back to the 1930s now where is mussolini and hitler in the 21st century,1
@Denise Farias It's been a long time since I've written that comment and I've looked into this topic and I agree with you. I think people think of the inequality just as blatant sexism (which does happen) but don't realise it's also the society's standard of upbringing that we should be critical of.,1
Today is my mom's birthday,1
He will drink and eat all night on me!,1
I like to see statues of people who killed my ancestors in America. Same thing for English statues for people who killed the Scottish and Irish ancestors too. It's a reminder to never let it happen again.,1
@Mike F. Dont you think the vexination  of young Africian childre is the fault of those leaders.   It's unthinkable that African goverment  pola poltions are in the business of selling their defenless children as test animales for profit when many are dying.    Money and corruption blinds.  China and Africa lack respect,1
I wish the poeple telling the cops that he couldnt breathe and to check his pulse like idk got a bunch of crownd amd pinned the officers down and saved george  everything happenes for a reason and we must not let his death go to waste we should learn from it and change the world for once or atleast america,1

Mtpimenta but others do Latinos and dark Asians do as well nnDawg blacks are just the loudest because nobody can go “ you weren’t born here so you don’t know anything” because most were born here nnBlacks are simply the loudest because they’ve been the second class citizens for the entirety of America’s history,1
@DragyTD People are reaching. Not once did anyone say 'ONLY black people lives matter' but when you're talking about stuff like 'Save the Turtles' people don't automatically assume that those that say it are saying that we should save ONLY turtles. People just don't want black people to have things to themselves. All the time we are expected to share our stuff. So people can stop lying about 'it implies that only black lives matter'. When SE Asians were being discriminated against in the UK and America not ONCE did someone say ALM and not once did people mention the struggles that people of other races go through UNTIL people said BLM. They didn't care before,1

@*It's Maya* Nope... Just an American that's tired of ridicule(mythical white privilege) & being backed into a corner. For what? Its 2020. Fighting over skin color is petty & should be beneath us.

there’s a difference between the intentions for saying it. A lot of people say it because they ARE racist and really to hate POC and are mocking deaths. But yes all lives matter but some lives apparently matter more which isn’t ultimately okay.,1

Churchill is a Racist. When India was a British colony 3 million people died of famine because Churchill ordered british officials to stock the grains for a future stockpile for british troops.

Some are shown here.n,1

I asked if I could have that and they said sure.nMy mom now tells me that I would spend hours upon hours putting them together in all kinds of ways,1

I love this Sheriff,1
There are only two sexes (and also intersex people so technically three sexes) but gender identity is up to the person. It’s a very western idea that there are only two genders and many other cultures believe differently and have believed differently for thousands of years. If a person wants to express their gender as something non binary to boy and girl they should have the freedom to do so. If they aren’t hurting anyone else why make them change into something they aren’t comfortable with,0

But can you name all the police officers that died in the line of duty by getting killed by shines like George,1
It's not about black lives. It's all about the tactics of intimidation by the police that sometimes escalates a situation and will lead to excessive force and generally due to the lack of cooperation by the suspect. When one's freedom is at stake one's instincts will lead to defending that Liberty and often times this is precipitated by the police officer allowing his emotions to get the best of him. It doesn't matter what race you are what matters is,0
A lot of our children are addicted.

xXX_ DANKITY_DOGE _XXx Well it’s a simple question & the fact that it’s a trigger for you is something you should ask yourself about & try to comprehend why you simply cannot answer that question! I didn’t ask you about other racial or ethnic groups of people I asked you specifically does Black Lives Matter? Why that is so difficult for you to simply answer yes or no I find that to be very strange! But I’m done beating this dead horse! You’ve said your piece & I think I understand where you’re coming from & why you can’t answer that question,1

Nothing happens? Are you dumb?? Most of time they put in jail vs a black men who die. They did nothing. That’s my problem with you people.

All lives matter but if black don’t lives matter what the point to says all lives matter??? My problem with you people or racist,1

@lockandloadlikehell This video isn't about rights. It's about stopping the cultural idea that women cannot go into STEM because it's perceived  as a masculine profession. A lot of female classmates I grew up with wer told constantly that girls can't do math. It's a cultural issue.,0

Feminist ladies suffering from microagressions. Please accept my sincere microapologies! But don't worry! The Patriarkitty will embrace you when you are all alone and no one wants to hang out with you. Even when you are beyond your 30s and no men wants to talk to you. Kitties will always be there for you...,1
As someone who dosnt really feel comfortable saying “I’m religious” but would say my beliefs fall most closely to Christianity and attends church regularly... this whole concept of conversation therapy disgusts me. I have read the Bible through and through. Yes the Bible does say that homosexual actions are sinful. It also says a thousand other things are sinful (things we are all guilty off in our lifetime) the Bible clearly says all sin is forgivable. The Bible says the greatest commandment is love. Jesus when faced with the option to condemn chose love over and over and over again. He forgave and he showed compassion. In fact the only people Jesus was super blunt or “mean” with. Was not the drunkerds,0
More white men are killed by police that black people,1
@Neet Freek Then how do you expect me to respect you if you don't in the first place? I have the right to not agree with homosexuality and that's it. It's what I think wether you like it or not.,1
@Splash 29 he got what was coming to him white lives matter,1
Democrats need to find out the facts before they open their yaps. EACH case they referred to were bogus claims of Police Brutality,1
She is confused.,1
@Forest Gump in 200 years time if it turns out that society finds the practice of making computers abhorrent for reasons that we don't understand today should we tear down statues of tech company executives who donated large sums of money to charity. Do people like Bill and Melinda Gates become cannon fodder to history? No we appreciate their kind work in the standards of their time. Honestly put some donation boxes on the statue and donate the funds to a slavery museum like the one in Liverpool. History is done. Nobody expects the vikings the pay back for the monasteries they burned or monks they enslaved. People that unfairly discriminate their fellow man today against modern values or argue that the slave trade was good today are the menace,1

@Jun3 Shiroyuki stfu of course people care when white people are killed by police i'm not an anarchist just because of BLM. The reason BLM exist is because its been proven multiple times that African Americans are more likely to get unjustly killed by police compared to white Americans.,1

Why weren't they all fined and possibly arrested?nIf you break the law pay the time,1
Exactly absolute bell ends the lot of them. Disgraceful behaviour and it only goes against them and there cause. Most of these probates have been on a ten week holiday and getting 80% of there wages while doing nothing. This how they repay the kindness mindless anarchy. People laughing and cheering it's pathelic. This is massive two fingers up the nurses and doctors. Pandemic is the priority everything is secondary at the minute.,0

There's a good chance the religious girl just said what she knew she had to say because she knows her community will probably watch the video,0
I'd even go as far as to say all people who wants to go into any kind of STEM should watch this. While it is mainly about getting girls into engineering,0
Every life doesn't matter only black lives do. That sounds so stupid.,1
stop assuming the sexuality of the girl that disagrees with homosexuality. it's not our business to label her as queer in denial or something. no matter what she identifies with/ is attracted to,0
the fact that this is 4 years ago is funny. its like everyone was talking about it and it went away and now that its election again,1
All lives do matter regardless of race. Period there is good and bad people of all races. We all need to come together and stop letting the media separate us this is ridiculous,0
Not every Black person in UK is decended from slaves but I understand why they pulled him down. Just annoyed at so many people with no masks,1

Depends. Do you expect her to do it for free or do you intend to pay her? How automated are we talking here? Do you want it to get the ingredients out of the refrigerator or do you want something you have to load manually? Be prepared to spend a few tens of thousands of dollars. Even Brown Bag makes most of the sandwiches by hand.,1
brandonshmandon  So yeah if a black man pointed a gun at a pregnant woman he should be killed brutally by police and if a white man kills 9 black people for no reason he should be arrested peacefully by police..... Got it,1
I don’t agree with homosexuality but it’s not my place to judge.,1
Santiago Cr but she can move her mouth,1
The council should have went also.,1
Truth is it’s a war on police. And it’s well deserved . Police are nothing but bullies and they creat havoc in the lives of average citizens . From civil forfeiture laws to the fake war on drugs the police are absolute tyrants. Nothing better than to see a blue uniform get taken down with violence... there have been a few hero’s who have stepped up to Th e challenge. They are called crazy but in reality they are fighting the tyranny,1

And this is why I love her so much,1
I hate how society now's portrays Christianity as some brainwashing cult. It's not. There are churches that are very corrupt and Christians that are very corrupt but not all are like that. There's a fine line between agreeing and supporting. I don't agree with homosexuality but I will support them. I don't HAVE to agree with it. It is against my religion. But on the other hand,1

Yeah. Black live matter..support you all from malaysia....,1

I don’t understand why saying black lives matter is really ok. It implies that all others don’t or aren’t. If I said white lives matter do you think it would be racist? If I said Asian lives matter would that be the same? Why? I understand that police brutality is out of control and needs to be addressed,0

The black lives matter movement isn't saying that other lives don't matter. It's saying that this minority group is still experiencing racial oppression and difficulties as an aftermath to a long history of racism. They just want to live in a safe neighborhood,1

Hey ppl i posted in the comments the link with the video of her stating the trained marxist did it not make it to the comment section? Because i can see my comment with the link. So im a bit surprised why people are still asking for a link or didnt even bother to check the video themselves...,1

I don't get why everyone whose homophobic is thought of as being in the closet. There are just a lot of hateful people that are just brainwashed by religion.,1
In this matter I'm not wrong because God clearly said that homosexuals will go to hell. If He hadn't said it in the bible,1
@BenjoBanjoo like the Tories and Brexit?,1
The civil war was caused because white people wanted to keep slavery. And you don’t have to agree with the political views of the BLM foundation. But we should all agree that black lives matter. That Marxist view does not define our movement and it does not take away what we are trying to accomplish,1
??? Really? Black means brown or African.,1
Agreed. We're born the as the sexualities we are so it'd be like saying I don't agree with black people,1
@Aria Maas That is the exact reason,1
UK Police are all for them     ie RotherhamnTV ad mid-week about Police recruitment showed 2 white brits against  20 BlacksnThe UK is a racist cess-pit...........................and its all from THEM,1

Morons. They probably didnt give a damn about this statue up to this point. I doubt they even noticed it. Then suddenly in the midst of a deadly virus they cant contain their moral outrage. I wonder how many ppl will die because of virus spreading protests. Clearly their lives didnt matter.,1

All lives matter. Anything else is racism.,0
this police officer needs to speak more,1
Delonte Hollister You sound loco in the head,1
why is everyone so annoyed at these CHILDREN. like cmon they are probably not very educated in this and yall screech if they even think about the word 'choice',0
It's a protest to the protest we're trying to reach to the police,1
Marguerite Kenny It’s the same with other more exotic names,1
Because like I’m so educated because like I’ve been to like Bristol uni like and they like taught me to like hate myself for being white like. Absolute special needs.,1

Some sjw protesters have literally ran into the fronts of stopped cars and then reported that they were rundown they feel so entitled to pity and victimhood which is turning a good idea spreading awareness into  just making black lives matter people seem like they have a victim complex well they're tossing over gay pride parades,1
Just shows you how long they plan stuff and sometimes how long it takes to process it into place,1
Hello! I love your videos! Can you please make a video about Kurdish Resistance ?,1

Patrick William await what,1
black people are not trying to be more important than other races. we are trying to tell you that we matter because we are going through bad things that other races have not experienced before. So we are trying to get you to notice that we matter so we could be equal with the other. we are not trying to be on top of the other races. we want to be equal.,1
It’s rude to attack someone who talking and the other person interrupts.  I applaud the cop. Saying black lives matter is saying remember us to. Stop. No one is stupid. Shame on you guys,1
@WillisthehynAll lives should matter.nBut Black Lives Don't seem to Matter.nThat's why there's a Black Lives Matter Movement. nUnderstanding?,1

@Sandy Castles In a indirect way your right. Depending on the school you can get very good results.  Schools are funded by property taxes and overseen by parents.nIn a bad neighborhood there is little money and little oversight.  Hence its not the State but the collective concern or lack of that determines the average outcome.   But to blame the State is a strawman argument.,1

Saying Black Lives Matter doesn't mean Screw everyone else who isn't black. Why don't White Americans get that?nThe fact that a group of people have to stand in protest and practically scream Hey! We deserve the right to life! because of the recent publicly exposed police brutality should be the concern here. Saying All lives matter is unnecessary and is doing an injustice to Black Americans. If all lives truly mattered then Black Lives Matter wouldn't be a movement so necessary today,0
​@themooch Your life does not matter. Sorry.,1
I think it's time to look in the mirror instead of looking at us. I've never owned a slave nor has anyone besides people in Libya. Obama killed the man that was going to free them. If black lives really mattered those slaves in Libya would be free. But gold was more important. That and Obama's role in knocking off countries for the cabal.,1
@Jun3 Shiroyuki oh really so the officer who put his knee of Flyod's neck would've done it to a white guy when this officer has a record of being racist and killing minorities,1

ALL LIVES MATTER bottom line because the U.S. is formed by all races nthe key problem in U.S. its because Police officers will use force against you if you resist an arrest that's when this contraversial misunderstanding errupts especially with black communities and latino communities this should had not happen if you STOP! resisting an arrest or resisting a detention resisting a search warrant that's what so contraversial because a police officer always use excessive force when they feel life threatening no matter your color of your skin resisting an arrest to a police officer in front of a camera is a serious offense and black people and colored people don't want to reconized it because they use the 5th amendment to battle challenge against police officers profile intreview an individual that are trying to do their job,1

she looks like a butch lesbian “i don’t agree with it” headass,1
The black lives matter movement reminds me a lot of the Black panther movement in the late 60s! They protested pretty much the same ideals! But were shut down by corrupt cops later on,1
This is BORING talk.... no logic and reason.,1
Have the same energy when racism happens towards Asians!,1
DT That’s just like saying “Send black people back to Africa”. Isn’t that a racist?,1
People really start to suck as they grow up. The younger kids were so sweet and accepting as opposed to the older girl who's clearly in a denial mode. About herself.,0

@Ambuscade He stood against the biggest cult of racist the world had seen. He rallied an entire country against Hitler. Yes he was racist but if it wasn't for him we'd wouldn't be alive today.,1
Garland English Racism is still prevalent in America and I guess it's not that big of a deal since protests have only spread throughout all 50 states and 18 different countries. I believe Fox news and right-wing propaganda has brainwashed you into believing the BLM movement is a total scam. Sure,1

Respect to the Sheriff. Nothing but sense.,1
@Molly Rebekah I understand you but in some places you are wrong I also disagree with homesexuality same as your reason if god has told us not to do so then we need to acknowledge that he knows better which is why we follow him but it won't get you sent to hell because as every other sin it is still a sin but us as humans think that we can rank it but we can't because only god will know so that's like saying if lie you will go to hell if it's repeatedly commit sins and feeling no emotion for forgiveness then you will go to hell,1
It's ok to be  racist as long as it's against white people  is what I'm getting from all this BS going on in the world and US. We are all created equal by God. I'm no better than next man or woman nor are they better than me .,1

There goes juan. He knows they are right,1
Ainura Cc hi. That’s the name of the official organization. I also think if the organization had a different name let’s say “black lives matter too” it will still get twisted in order to dilute the meaning. I agree that all lives matter but people only started saying that AFTER black lives matter became a thing,1

All people getting abused by the police but the media only covers African American majority of the time to cause racial tension amongst people when it is not necessary police abuse everyone the only way this world can get better is unity amongst people we have to put race color creed and religion behind us to improve the future of the world there's only one race the human race the good must stick together and get rid of the bad that's thats what it boils down to it's available color its about Good vs evil good and evil is all over this world it has to be separated,1

Floyd died from heart problems with 90% blockage in one artery and 75% in another.  Floyd was a career criminal who already spent 7 years in jail mostly from home invasion with a gun put to a pregnant woman's stomach while his mob went through the woman's home stealing all her possessions.    Floyd feared going back to jail for his forgery scheme and the stress caused heart failure.  Floyd got his justice even though it should have been much earlier.  (Go to the Stefan Molyneux channel for a good video about Floyd).,1
and her body language,1
I thought EXACTLY  THE SAME THING!!!!!!,1
Please take them all!,1
The fact a lot of people become famous and forget who helped them become famous and Madonna did not! She basically saying the lgbtq helped me become me and in return I’m forever in there “debt.” (In a good way) and I will never forget that and will All ways help out. It’s not just saying okay I support the lgbtq it’s acutely doing something on a daily and not just during pride and Madonna shows that and she helped us as we helped her and that’s amazing!!!,0
If so many people hate racism,0

Hey- a lot of the people you may be thinking of did nothing against the law. You might not be aware about a kid foot instance called Elijah McClain who was going to the store and had the cops called as he was looking suspicious. Look up the story. Or other people who were just going home. I know people stopped constantly in their own car. On the way to work. In their Worker's Uniform. You know better now than to make a blanket statement like this.,1
They thought it's cool to protest.,1
For this reason God gave them up to dishonorable passions. For their women exchanged natural relations for those that are contrary to nature; 27 and the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another,1

The problems is that one doesn't negate the other.  If All Lives Matter then what is the problem with saying Black Lives Matter or Blue Lives Matter? They are a part of the All am I correct?  Not like when the constitution said We hold these truths to be self-evident,0
@p jay people have the freedom of religion so we are still going to believe this true and historical accurate book talking about our lord and savior Jesus Christ,1

Just a correction to what you said about the BLM Toronto stuff.  Per the article you have in your video,1

All Lives Matter!! Follow the laws and be productive citizens in society then your life will matter otherwise you put your life in danger and it will not matter.,0
It is not a celebration these days. It's a historical reminder,1
Sherriff Clark is da man,1
MrCosmin94 and your statement “opening” people’s minds is completely invalid when you yourself have no prior knowledge to a actual topic. And making a point as bland as “who created god “ is like asking which universe created the universe. Because from a naturalistic view there has to be a natural non divine explanation. And based on the Laws of thermodynamics energy can’t just appear and disappear but be constant. So when you take nothing and create an infinite expanding universe with finite energy that is always constant and never created or taken away you come to question how that energy got there in the first place? It is the reasonable human reaction. So to tell people who have found peace in an answer for themselves makes you someone that can’t stand others happiness or comfortability. You would think being a human being you would have more compassion towards others and their own choices. Like I don’t judge you for yours,1
@TheLegend27 Is Alive I'm glad that you agree and stuff,1
@Healthcare Matters How's that??,1
Black lives matter claims they are being oppressed and their children os being denied a education.,1
@Rigo Batiancila That's where you're a bit wrong like Ashton Kutcher said yes all lives matter but to some racist people black lives don't matter when it should matter here! Therefore BLM is not a disgrace here!,1

This video is so pointless.nThe women themselves look bored as shit and provide no proper facts or incidences within their working environments that prove Silicon Valley institutions are sexist.nThe fact that there are way less females in this employment sector is NOT sexist.

Bea Millan-Windorski Love how you assume being talked down to is exclusive to women...sexist.,1
leo A I agree with u on that & it’s always Politics when Dems act stupid Election time,1
Being pro-life and pro-sterilization is not hypocritical. nnBasically you can believe that a mother shouldn't get herself pregnant AND believe that if she does get herself pregnant that she shouldn't be allowed to murder her kid.nnThis is no stranger than pro-life people advocating abstinence. They're not trying to make sure women have babies; they just don't approve of murdering children.,0
How is that soft butch homophobic,1
And I’ll talk to you like an adult. If I get stabbed in my femoral artery and blood is gushing out it’s not fair to look at me and look at someone with a Papercut and say that you’ll help the person with the paper cut first(Papercut is white bleeding out of your femoral artery is every other person). It’s not saying that you don’t have a problem it’s saying that our problem is way worse than yours.,1
No...lol It could be just someone who disagreed with lgbt+ that’s what I told my mom,1
Jens I’m not offended by black lives matter. The first comment in this topic was about how the slogan was racist. I went on to say that I don’t think it’s racist but I had my concerns how it could be causing a divide and doing more harm than good . nA good number of the comments on here say it’s racist so clearly some people have an issue with it,0
There literally is no right side to BLM it doesnt matter what side you're on. You're always going to be wrong in someone's eyes.,1
I was an engineer and starting to be an 8th grade math teacher just this year at 53.,0
George Floyd was a criminal who unfortunately lost his life due to a legal police hold while he resisted arrest (as he had just committed fraud and had a history of crime) with NO racist intentions. The 4 officers who assisted to hold him down were 1 black 1 Asian and 2 white officers. How is this racist????? Loony left agenda to control the west.,1
I cackled,1

@you are totally right,1
Black lives do matter and anyone who says different need to go put some duck tape over their mouths! And other lives matter to but we need to work at one thing first then go to the next if we go out and say this life matters and starts a whole protest it will get out of control we should take it one at a time.,1
ALL lives matter period.  I am surprised i never saw this article till now.,1
Black Lives Mater Agenda....whats your thoughts?,1
Bot gonna lie but the BLM movement is the biggest racist thing I've ever seen (aside from slavery). I don't know about you guys but I saw one human being unjustly kill another human being. So shouldn't it be human lives matter,1
@Whatsgoingoninmycrib History is written by the winners it is never the truth,1
I like how this video,1
U cant justify or compare slavery with religion u need to stop talking about prizms and start thinking out of the box,1
You’d think the statue wouldn’t have even made it to the pavement without the local authority’s getting involved,1
BLM was created for the division of race. A genuine good person would have made a movement called ALL LIVES MATTER. Knowing the system is messed up and all races are subjected to police brutality. If ALM was spoken,1

@Johnathan nostar Um...Jesus did exist,1

Can we stop with this idiotic argument? People are saying Black Lives Matter because they think black lives are oppressed and they should be pumped up to the same level as other lives. It's wrong but that's what they think. End of argument. Can we now focus on all the traitors to this country? Like the governor of Seattle letting an autonomous community spring up in front of his eyes? Or the victimhood mentality that is damaging MOST youth? It's a whole generation poisoned by leftist ideology. Hope they find a path in their lives and that they somehow develop a skill and a career. If not,1
She looks so beautiful,1
Bruh people have been racist to eachother for centuries. You can't let racism happen and it's not like people from the past cared that much about it.,1
I want to know why Blacks always bring up Slavery and never Mention that it was Blacks that sold them into Slavery? George Floyd should not be Memorialized as Victim of Race. He was a Drug Dealer/Druggie and a Multi-Convicted Felon. His Career of Crime started when he was 16 years old. He was no Dr. Martin Luther King.,1
You just made a stereotype comment. Just because a person has short hair or seems queer or whatever,1

She's just a kid don't you think it's a bit rude and invasive to be analyzing her sexuality a kids sexuality,1

@Anesu Nambware I see you did not bother to mention anything about the WHITE woman that was murdered. I find the statement BLACK lives matter Offensive and RACIST towards me as It should have said ALL lives matter. The FACT you have to bring up MLK from over 50 yrs ago shows you still live in the past. I have always taken people at face value regardless of their skin colour but to try and rewrite history by pulling monuments down and wanting to get rid of things like the confederate flag and ban tv shows and movies is going to the extreme in my opinion. History is important as we should try and learn from it.,1

I love you Madonna. I needed you so much in this life. You are someone to admire. Thank you so much for everything.,1
Why exactly police allowed them to block them? I am not familiar with law in USA but in my country if you officialy announce demonstration or parade or any public action like that and they aprove it (which they always do unless you are asking for something really silly) then any group blocking you during it will get removed by police quite swiftly. Why it was not like this in this case?,1

@angeline nguyen whyy,1
Sadly it is being put as a trend. But black people are still suffering and they are downplaying us and trying to shut us up.nWe just want racial equality and to defund the police. It seems they are doing everything but that. But we shouldn’t use this important movement to turn attention to something else that isn’t the matter at hand. We will fight for equality then we will spread out to those regions too. They are all equally as important but we have to stay focused. I hope you understand this.,0

Black lives matter is a racist organization built on hate and lies,1
Yes all black lives matter but black people use that as superior. And some whites who are using black lives matter as like it are a joke,1
Another Cultural Marxist.  IF she is really an engineer what has she done?  Maybe the fact that women are more interested in advocacy and groupthink is why we shouldn't waste time training them.  Reminds me of that other Jewish woman agitating for more women in video games.  I guess gender doesn't matter....unless you can agitated for women?   This is more mushy thinkiing.  Things can only get better with a female perspective?  So are we going to ACKNOWLEDGE MEN AND WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT?  YES OR NO?  You Cultural Marxists can't keep up with your own lies.  Ted is pretty much trash now.,1

No because they literally have said all lives can’t matter until black lives matter smh because if you’re black you can’t be racist. All built on a lie. Black people are not being gunned down by cops everyday in the streets.,1
statistics wise yes more White people are killed by Cops then black people.   But Also Statistics Wise more (Unarmed) Black people are killed by Cops there's a Difference.   Also Anyone Who has a Counter Protest like All Lives Matter are a Racist or Bigot because they don't care how many (Unarmed) (unjustly) Black people are being killed so once White privilege is Taken away ND White Supremacy we will have peace.,1

It's because its nice to have big events where LGBT+ people can go and meet people who are like them or have similar experiences as them and feel at home and like they belong somewhere. There are no parades for those things because those are more socially excepted things. Have you ever heard of a country that doesn't accept a straight man? It's just a nice way to make friends or if people give you a hard time about who you love usually,0

to say all lives matter indicates a lack of sensitivity for the current plight of blacks.it means that you have no concern for the recent murders of blacks. it also undermines a movement that seeks to hold officers accountable for their crimes that are bold,1

Good for you and your family that you're healthy now and its ok you decide to see those as acts of god but they're  not . religious people will see miracles everywhere.

Someone fighting cancer will survive if god wants them to or die if god wants them to and sometimes they will throw the devil here and there in the equation . I have no faith in god yet I'm healthy and happy but many of my family members who go to church everyday are ill,1

The level  of ignorance Michael brown attack a police officer and try to get his gun!!!!,1
Mmmm. I would disagree. Religion is belief if you believe something hard enough it stops becoming a choice. People in soviet Russia were brainwashed to make them love Stalin. They couldn’t make an active choice to deny it because that’s the way they perceived the world around them. It’s like seeing a green apple and trying to convince yourself it’s not green. It’s almost impossible because that’s how you see it. If a religious person sees homosexuality as wrong and believe it enough it becomes less of a choice and more of  a perception of the environment around them.,1
So at this time. And for a long time. Black and brown are abused and murdered at a high rate. So it’s nothing wrong with accentuated and pointing out the obvious.  What about statistics ?,1

@Ashxr and we dont hate people for who they are like she said your looking at it wrong. We dont hate we just leave you alone. It simply means you do you but we arent apart of it. For example ALL of my friends are apart of the LGBTQ even my best friends and I'm christian. Just because we are straight and religious doesnt mean we are monsters we are humans too,0

Can you please do a video on the fact that if God made a man and a woman(2 people) then their children would have to have to reproduce with their parents or their siblings. I am pretty sure that somewhere in the Bible it says this is wrong. At least this is wrong by current law so by creating Adam and eve God was encouraging them to break at least moral law,1

@***** The movement began in reaction to the deluge of unarmed black victims of police (and wanna-be police) violence in the news recently. To get your panties all bunched up about the name is irrational. If you want to start a movement you can call it whatever you want. A movement to raise awareness and political consciousness about police brutality would be a great cause,1

@Borjana Trajkova You don't agree with how a person came into this world despite the fact it doesn't hurt anybody,1
Are there other statues of slave traders still up in the UK? They should all be removed immediately. It is shameful that they were ever even put up in the first place,1
Now stop this protesting because we are all equal. My best friend is black and even she says all of this is blown out of proportion. Yesterday in the U.K. I seen 2 black police officers dragging a white man across the pavement. You don’t see me recording it shouting at them saying there racist. There doing there job,0

Ya as someone who has worked in the IT feild I call scripted bullshit propaganda  cause they do not go into specfics at all on what type of engineer they are on top of that if you break it down they are just over senstive about being asked questions THAT EVERY PERSON IS ASKED WHEN IN A HIGH LEVEL FIELD  and too top that off women are 7x more likley to be taken into stem and tech fields even if they are insainley unskilled in the field my brother who is a computer engineer has had to fix the mistakes hundreds upon hundreds of times of diversity hires who dont know anything about computers but cant complain cause its sexist and they cant be fired cause the boss had to hire them even though they cause the majority of complaints,1
It's crazy how Black Americans Conservatives are standing up to the Liberals because its a crime being a white person with opinions.,1

A kind gentle man has to endure torture because he just prefers his own gender. Whatever sexual acts he does at least 90% of heterosexual women do for their partners also. Why is it so terrible. What is wrong with religious people to condemn something that is neither bad or unnatural. The profess to be the religion of love yet are so hateful and intolerant.,0
Apparently only “black lives matter” and everyone doesn’t. The BLM movement won’t be happy until all other races are wiped off the face of the earth. Smh,1

This autistic dhiarea can be only swallowed by regressive cucklords. Fuck you Wired for trying to forcefeed us this regurgitated PC identity politics. Fuck you and good bye.,1
It's funny but they did not complain about it when we let them in. All those blacks would not want to come to Britain if this country was poor. This country is rich because of our past empire.

DEFENDING the right of the LGBTQ community to live however they like and being accepted for who they are AND in the same time ATTACKING someone because they have a different opinion/belief (maybe similar to what those horrible people are justifying their actions with) as long as they are not personally hurting anyone is highly HYPOCRITICAL.nIf you don't have anything good to say respectfully,0

Then I realized,1

Good on the protesters for managing to do in a few hours what the council couldn't do for years.,1

Smh at white ppl doing this to their own kind. Let blks fight their own battle,1
Yay! I'm a hostile sexist too!!! I have that weird feeling that teachers who seduce their students are responsible for that situation … just like I think that college girls who get drunk at frat parties are responsible for the sex they have there.,1
Race baiting. Soros funds BLM and ANTIFA. As well as snopes,1
Its NOT!!!! Some like seperation.....That is what this is all about!!!!! Do not allow this further attention or gain... make it about what it is police brutality on humans!,1
@CrimsonTide so true!  And are people just expecting you to quit just because you are getting older?  Frank Sinatra sang for a very long time passed his so called prime but he still sang beautifully.  So why stop because of age?,1
omg  we are the people All LIFES ARE important,0
DAniel andersson right now!,1
Because it doesn't fit the agenda,1
Absolutely Asian lives matter !,1
@semen stains the mountain tops you are right anyone in America who works hard or Has Talent can and will succeed. We have successful minorities in all fields in America. Doctors,1
Black lives matter is racist all they wanna do disrupt peace,1
Hit it right on the nail when he said they are whoring for votes...especially Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden.  Shamelessly playing the race card,1
+whistlz good idea,1
Thank you Madonna you're by years an inspiration and an openminder knight.,0
Covid 19 is very happy because more black lives will be taken after this mass protest around the world,1
Of course they don't want police at the pride parade. BLM does not want gays to have police protection...from BLM.,1

@Prima Materia And the Koran?,1
I don’t agree with your name,1
@Donquixote Doflamingo Oooh what a great point! Typical Trump supporter,1
David Clarke is very scary. I feel guilty of something when he talks. He is a boss though.,1
just because you say something is happening doesn't make it so. not to say that this video is completely inaccurate,1
james bolem look up the actual meaning of BLM 2020. We want equality for all races. We want to end oppression. We want to end killing of innocent ppl. We want to end brutality. We want to end stereotypes. If you can’t see that,0
I know right? Some people are too stupid to see the problems existing in the world,1
T Robinson Don't get your knickers in a twist  and butt out  !,1

I'm more concerned about the next few months.,1
They are privileged apologists!,1
@Dangus the reason people say black lives matter and not all lives matter is that in the eyes of many people,1
The balance of truth Listen and learn it’s tru,1
Who wants a bet that in 6 months time the BLM movement would have changed their name and re-branded to distance themselves from the stigma of everything that has happened over the last couple of weeks. Rioting in the middle of a pandemic,1
Wow.... so nobody else's life matters ... ok...gotcha,1
Mugieq its cursed,1
Cancel culture is a hiding to nothing,1

I completely agree with a statement that the sheriff made,1
I think ALL LIVES MATTER,0
That would just be uh- pure mean  Spitting F A C T S,1
Yes because all these people are black aren’t they mate,1
This is touching that so many people want to take part and stand up for others (and themselves). Many people see protesting as negative and terrible,1
When I was 12 I figured out that I was lesbian my mom said that I’m not her daughter anymore and sent me to my auntie in Newzeeland,0
None of our life's matter to them.  What matters to them is keeping us divided.,1

Black Lives Matter To Who???,1
The purpose of the All Lives Matter Movement  or All Lives Matter theory is to shut down and eliminate the Black Lives Matter Movement because the lives of Black people does not,1
Focus on the demand and not the supply.,1
@Johnathan nostar Psalms chapter 24 VERSE 1.,1
@Iroor I never interpreted what you said as if you were saying the slogan needed changing.nI was merely emphasising the utter hypocrisy and intolerance on issues pertaining specifically to race. Why does Alm as a slogan have no relevancy to blue lives matter? This indicates to me a fundamental bias. You also overlooked my issue with all lives matter as it relates to counter protests against blm.,1
Poor lives matter. That's the true root of the issue.,1
I was listening to this and I realized she said small town in Rhode Island and I'm like I'M FROM RHODE ISLAND considering how small the state is I could probably throw her a ball.,1

More whites killed by cops than blacks killed by cops. I think we need a movement to combat the brutalization of white citizens by the police. nnWHITE LIVES MATTER,1

Maddona saved my Soul in 1999,1
MrMojoman1236 We say it because we don’t want people to be divided. When people say “black lives matter” it causes a division in a sense to anyone who isn’t black.,1

Black lives matter phrase comes from police brutality to black folks duh dey tryna down play it n and act like we starting saying black lives matter out the blue 🤦‍,1
There is no excessive use of force by the police in the WESTERN world ....If the criminals complied they would not die ..,1
I think in a lot of ways you're dead on with that.,1

All of you naysayers are the fools that are brainwashed to not look at people like Madonna as good or inspirational. She helped a lot of people in the community she’s discussing. You see good PR and satanism. You’re the brain dead and brainwashed ones and have a bleak outlook.,1
@On The Far Right Do you actually believe blacks ever had enough power to push theirselves in any direction?nJust a few generations back blacks were seen as less than human with the slavery and Biblical rule,1

It's kind of common sense- plain logic 101nBut- here's the analogy.  nAll houses matter- But we're going to FOCUS on the one ON FIRE right now-,1
Wow am studying mechanical engineering and this is motivational so much as a female,0
Right we should give all our money to black people right always right and they can do whatever they want and they can say whatever they want and they can tell us why people that we can't say certain things and we can't do certain things and we can't be in certain rooms and all that but they can do whatever they want and have all the money right I mean that's that's what we should do right,1
Religious? What religion?,1

Find JESUS  for forgiveness and respect .   nOnly Fear GOD ....nLove. . ..  nnYou're welcome,1
It's because this is just dividing people,1
C'mon Annie. Come out already! Ffs,1
Biggest racist group out there is BLM,1
im color blind,1
That’s a ridiculously stupid conclusion to come to. Just sayin’. It IS against  God’s Law but we can speak against it and still love people and not put them through this torture. The equilibrium is possible contrary to popular belief.,1
Saying  All lives matter in response to Black lives matter is kind of ignorant almost a smart mouthed response. If a child told his mother I'm hungry and she responded Everyone gets hungry it undermines the child's point. The child didn't say everyone doesn't get hungry he was just bringing attention to his current hunger. In fact he's agreeing with her,1
I think that the girl who doesn’t agree with The LGBTQ+ community clearly doesn’t know enough about the subject to have a real opinion... my guess was that she was raised this way cause she didn’t really know who to describe why or how she disagreed. Just a thought,1
Skrezo Loving the same gender is a sin? Then a good chunk of the population is a sinner. There is nothing wrong with being LGBTQ+.,0

the Bible contradicts itself way too much,1
Because MSNBC wouldn't have any bloody news to corrupt .,1
The sheriff and larry are awesome juan is a demokkrat puppet....,1
It's hurting when people like the sheriff talking like that coz he feels white after making it to the whites club,1
The only thing I find a little sad about this is that even when women show an interest in engineering. It seems in America and the UK there is no interest or acknowledgement of shop floor engineering everyone seems to think its design work what ever field it is when she said engineer what ever happened to a man/woman in overalls hunched over a machine actually creating what they have designed,1
because not everyone falls for PR,1

God loves all his creation,0
You can immediately see which kids are brought up right and are just a light to this world and who isn't.,1
@Kurt Sandberg if you are saying that in response to BLM then let me give you a lesson. The reason black lives matter started was because we want all lives to matter. Saying all lives matter is just being selfish and wanting to not feel like the bad guy. Because whites aren't bad,0
Please stop with the fillers. The face is distorted.,1
It has nothing to do with race,1
I'm a straight Christian female from a religious family and our mindset has always been that just because I don't agree with your choice does not mean i'm gonna hate you for it (it's like hating someone because theyre a different raligion). A few of my best friends are LGBT and that kid phrase it better then I ever could,0

That's the difference between the average person and the researcher/analyst/scientist. The average person would look at that and take it at face-value then leave it that. The analyst would say hmmm I wonder why that is? There must be a reason or a cause for that to happen then they go do extensive research to figure it out & almost always the answer goes much deeper than just the simple oh it must be because they don't like it. Don't downplay the human psyche. Things are not always black and white.,1
White Lives Matter! White lives have been depreciated throughout decades. Whites are called racists because of skin color. Who wants to start a movement and march? We will accept all nationalities that will help honor white color. Don’t cause a white out! White privilege matters!!,1

I took up an Industrial Engineering course long time ago I didnt finish my course. 1st year to 3rd year I was doubting myself that I cannot make it to the final year and when I reached the 4th year that was the moment that I was so eager to finish the course but unfortunately I wasn’t able to enrol for 2nd semester due to financial challenges. When the speaker said that they were on 5 female students in the class...I remembered those days when we were also 5 girls and no excuses on all of our classes and demos. I am now 36 years old. I don’t see myself going back to study and continue the same course but I really wish I did.,0

Because being straight is the norm and people assume that everybody is straight. Because a lot of people are homophobic you grow up hating yourself and being fearful to say who you truly are.,0
Think about it this way by only saying black lives matter you are putting down every other race including Native Americans. They have it every bad because they got pushed out of their homes where their beliefs are so their basically taking a page out of Hitler’s book and say that Black is the master race when that isn’t true because there is no master race everyone should be equal.,0

@Tsu 800 Blk people are lazy now bcus we no longer work for free.,1
That sheriff is a strong man with his independent view on things. Much respect.,1
Why don't they just say 'Black Lives Matter Too'. Then at least the 'Too' suggests they're like others without highlighting purely one colour.,1
@CRYxBABY It's because it's universally understood that white lives already matter. nCurrently the evidence shows that black lives are not as much of a priority as white lives. 🤷‍nnSystematic racism.,1

I am a Christian I don’t agree with gayness and all of that but I will still be kind and respectful,1
I am so glad this dude is no longer a sherriff...that I know. This is the guy that agrees with the knee on the neck which departments use nationwide. All ya have to do is watch LIVE PD...oh yea they pulled one of the most transparent police shows EVER! Every cop on LIVE PD is a very good one. I will say that Police use the knee to the neck ALL the time so let's not say this is a isolated incident. People have had problems with the knee to the neck restraint for a long time. Now we see why. The worst thing about David Clark is his uniform. All that flash ain't authorized and if it is...well then shame on the me!,1
That's horrible and inexcusable to do to another human being even more so a child! Whether a person agrees with homosexuality or not DOES NOT give them the right to play God and judge another on their sexual preferences. I believe in reading the Bible and showing love and acceptance in one another and focus on verses such as John 8,0
@jmal lol yeah none of us said that,1
They got it wrong,1
@speve _ nYour wish came true,1

No there's nothing worth looting,1
I liked what the sheriff said.nMakes sense.nThe Democrats are 2-faced pigs.nPeace to all!nAmen.,1
They wasn’t outraged at this statue a week or so ago .. They are only doing this to jump on the bandwagon of America,1

@Miles Mackenna Is #1 because of her short hair?,1
It shows you that Fox News is anti Black Lives Matter. We all know that Fox News doesn't care about black people.,1
You say you wouldn't tell someone how to live but you don't want me to talk about God. You want me too agree with you so you want me to live and think like you. I haven't told anyone how to live. I'm telling people how God wants them to live. This is a new account btw,1
Time to unite and vote Republican,1
Are there any statues of those sellers? Or is there a point in your statement?,1
@Ray All lives matter then you should have no problem saying black lives matter.,1

We will think differently after watching this video >>>,1
xXX_ DANKITY_DOGE _XXx Who said there was a controversy? What evidence are you speaking to because I don't think it's controversial at all! What's note worthy is the use of all lives matter as a response to Black Lives Matter! If you can't say that Black Lives Matter can you truly believe that all lives matter? Vice president Mike Pence was asked by a journalist can you say the words Black Lives Matter & he refused,1
Yooo kid. I don’t think you understand. Blacks were brought over here hundreds of years ago to be forced to work in shitty conditions. Our ancestors put their blood,1

@Dat Boi david dorn is the cop. I need to find the name of white guy that got killed though. David dorn was protecting a atore for looters when he got killed. He was an ex captian for the police,1
and the opposite of that is that men doesn't talk about issues and let them linger. and the problems become deeper and deeper. im talking generally here offcourse.  You 50 years late with this diatribe. precisely the reason the original feminism had to appear.,1
The thing is nobody really said white lives don’t matter,1
I'm all in for equality but I think what the future holds for USA is akin to the aftermath of Nazi rule in Germany. The German government is now very apologetic to the Jews. People (Whites) maybe will become very sensitive to slight a black person? According to me,1
Police shouldn't bother.  They should go after rapists,1

Its controversial because Its used as an excuse when they get caught jumping someone in the subway for their wallet and cell phone.,1
Thank you to everyone taking part in the BLM movement- even if it's just listening. nnThis movement is not for a selfish cause. Black people are being penalized and executed and we desperately need your help to stop the bleeding. nNo one is asking for a handout. We simply want justice and fairness for all race. nnThank you!,1
Would it matter if books burned? We can copy the pages or transfer the information into a online format. Technically we don’t even need books anymore,1
@Grizzly Bear  Trump has God in his heart but his actions speak louder then what's in his heart. Masters beat their slaves with a Bible in one hand and a whip in the other. God has been used for evil purposes because the mind of man is weak and easily deceived. Your statement suggests to me that you have been deceived.,1

It's not that you disagree with the fact that it exists,1
i was going to sub but after seeing that this video exists,1
BLM only when white people are involved.,1
They're not protesting anything but the fact that they want whitey to supply them with everything for free. You morons are setting yourself up for the big fall.,1
I suppose that's right seeing as the greatness of the country can often be thanked by its oppressive history,1
I literally cried! Omg i cant believe the people still doing this! I am so sensitive and empathy,1
Absolutely beautiful,1
It’s wrong to say ELM because BLM CuLT is racist. Fact!! GO AHEAD WHITE PEOPLE THAT ARE OUT THERE WITH BLM SAY SOMETHING AS A SPEACH IN FRONT OF THEM AND THEY WILL TELL YOU “ SIT DOWN YOU DONT HAVE A VOICE FOR US” They are using you to look like idiots to kneel for them like slaves smh in 2020 REALLY!!!,1

To answer the question - not all lives matter to BLM.,1
Fear Dheas I agree totally,1
@Molly Rebekah But how do you know God exists there is no evidence for example if we burned every religous book ever and every science book ever in 1000 years time there would be no christianity as we know it or it would be changed drastically however all the science books would be back and be exactly the same as the results would read the same where religion is totally up to interpretation.,1

You said it yourself. doing something negative over another race is racist Too many black people unarmed have died from cops compared to how many black people live in the US. This with the other factors show that black lives do not matter to alot of people. BLM saying BLM is a cry out to be noticed. People wanting racial equality would not have to say anything if it was already equal.,1
she seems very genuine and emotional here. i feel like i’ve not seen this side of her in forever. so much love,1
Republicans are so dysfunctional lol,1
All lives matter and frankly from what I've seen is that gun laws in America are yet again the true problem whether out of prejudice towards the colour of skin I think it's ludicrous the chances between the rich and poor are divided and that is where the true issue is it is difficult to get rid on one bigoted billionaire that so happens to be the president of the United States but laws around the world have no difficulties ridding poor people out of the society so therefore I'm afraid that the majority is playing a dangerous game of racial anger that can result in a civil war that would not be beneficial for whatever colour of skin you've put your bets on so when I say all lives matter I mean to say,0
And the 80% comes to an end soon.,1

Second that. So true.,1
The Sheriff needs to enter politics. He has the common sense and savvy to be great,1
It is a big bad shame that BLM protests over the death of criminals and not the children gunned down for fun by the neighborhood gangsters. There are no Crips and Bloods here,1
She’s done nothing for my life. Your train of thought must be as deep as a puddle.,1
That's just as bad as hearing gun shots,1
Vanesa people aren’t making him into the great person to exist. He’s just an example of police brutality. And his death is so noticeable because he even told the officers that he can’t breathe. They aren’t just talking about him they are many other people others are talking about. And I get that he was a criminal but we don’t need to focus on that because that doesn’t mean he had to die when his death had nothing to do with what happened 5 years ago. If trump supporters can ignore the fact that trumps a racist and a rapist I think we can ignore what crimes George did five years ago.,1
I really want people to stop using religion as an excuse for ignorance,1
Juan is a pathetically racist black man who constantly blames white people for the problems in the black community. You can see the anger in his face when challenged with the truth. Why doesn't go to another network which is more compatible with his beliefs?,1
Madonna has only grown stronger and wiser while being arguably the most famous person in the world.  She has survived and thrived will many of her peers have not.,1

Alm And I'll explain I'm not the one that is racist So I don't feel like I should be forced to say blm just because of some racist people I already think black lives matter,1

THE BK honestly there’s always going to be racism. It’s never going to stop because people don’t have love in their hearts. Just hate and sin. But my message is BLM - movement is not helping the situation at all. It’s only makes matters worse.,1
Stop racism at it's source,0

@Ziggy Zolik I know you'll never respond to this but judging people shouldn't be illegal cause it's their opinions and you don't have to  agree but they shouldn't be silenced. Look I don't like it when people are judged and LGBTQ people deserve their rights but they shouldn't be this sensitive,1
@Elizabeth Crosland 🤣🤣🤣,1
@Mark Tunstall I agree. The question for me though is whether BLM is directly causing violence or not,1

The Catholic priests say otherwise. She's not mother Teresa who actually lived in poverty even though she won 1.5 million with a novel priest prize and really saved lives and souls. Madonna is a woman who lives for herself and had two abortions. nShe's a rich performer with a messed up life and she is not a role model. Take what you can but beware.

So they should decide whether  they hate those who brought their ancestors by force to US or love because of them they live now in developed country. It seems like they want eat a cake (their ancestors had been living in slavery  ) and have a cake (they are living in developed country).

@Jason Devon Unfortunately the traditional definitions of right and left in politics have been completely distorted by the leftist 'woke' agenda. By traditional standards I would consider my political views to be slightly left of centre - for instance I'm in favour of universal healthcare and a compassionate welfare state. But by today's 'woke' standards I'd be branded as far right because I don't think transgender women should be allowed to compete in women's sport and I think this 'non-binary' stuff is attention seeking bullshit.,1

@Jose Luis statistics wise yes more White people are killed by Cops then black people.   But Also Statistics Wise more (Unarmed) Black people are killed by Cops there's a Difference.   Also Anyone Who has a Counter Protest like All Lives Matter are a Racist or Bigot because they don't care how many (Unarmed) (unjustly) Black people are being killed so once White privilege is Taken away ND White Supremacy we will have peace.,1

Because it’s totally unrealistic. It will take generations to even come close to stopping racism and discrimination.

@Molly Rebekah Girl I'm Christian too and you are waaaaaaaaaaaaay outta line. What I'm taught from the bible and what I see it saying is that we should love all. Do you believe that God loves each and every one of us cause that's what we are taught as Christians that he loves everyone of us. So the fact you think God doesn't like LGBTQ people is misinformed because God loves all of us not just some of us ALL of us.nnIt's people like you that give us Christians a bad name because you want to make your own version of life where God only likes what you think and that's what you tell people. When in fact God loves all of us and wants us to love eachother like we want to be loved.  So before you come here claiming to be Christian go and rethink everything you think and read up on what God teaches us. nnnLike girl bye.,0

That sheriff has more testosterone than the Fire Lord,1
The reason that All Lives Matter has become an offensive statement is because that phrase only originated to counteract the Black Lives Matter movement. The All Lives Matter phrase was never popularized until Black Lives Matter became a strong force in the country.,1

@Indiana Rose nWhilst I hear what youre saying..the good thing about Christianity(not to be confused with hateful American evangelism) is that it evolves..through time..scientific discovery and public debate..you know we now no longer believe the earth is flat or execute people for working on the Sabbath...now we take our advice on sexuality from experts called sexologists...not bronze age dessert tribesmen who knew nothing about the complexities and diversified of human sexuality..in the UK senior clergy are calling for some now deceased homosexuals to receive recognition and award for their good works that benefited society.,1

@Aaron Lehman So it would be ok for a group of all-white people to walk around with banners that say 'White lives matter' and shout it out to all black people?......white people die too...and we know it's sad and enraging and emotional but we can't afford to seperate ourselves like that...seperation and segregation IS racism......don't fight racism by being racist...just be Human.

GameRoll nHaven't you noticed that people do the same thing for all their fallen heroes and dearly departed?   The best time for cold analysis of a person's life is probably NOT shortly after he/she has gone.  Also people have a tendency to make IDOLS of the dead when it is politically or otherwise convenient.  We cannot blame Mr. Floyd for immoderate comments which others have made about him following his brutal murder.   For it remains a fact that he was murdered.   nnnNow I didn't hear any of these allegations about his behavior before.  It neither surprises me to hear it,1
That sheriff is scary,1

Nothing wrong with the term all live matter. But it's only used because people started using black lives matter. It's used to drown out black lives matter. Not one person screaming all lives matter everytime someone says black lives matter is protesting with black people. Unless they are counter protesting.,1

Yo for real why do all of you guys care so much about what her sexuality is gonna be? Because she has short hair and wears cuff jeans?  A lot of people wear cuff jeans and have short hair that aren't LGBT+. I'm okay if she does become LGBT+,0

Do you know what's really racist? Them saying that ONLY black lives matter. Oh,1
@Brutal Honesty Enjoy your day.,1
Of course ALL LIVES MATTER!! But often Black peoples lives are relatively undervalued in the US! Saying Black Lives Matter is not saying that they’re more important then other lives,1
She is pretty and smart!! wow!!!,0

MultiDarkZen I have no doubt that you think feminism is a hate group. You're just not the first one to say so in the past century and you won't be the last. There's a reason why academics tend to be feminists while uneducated people are not.nnI haven't watched the red pill but from what I read in Wikipedia it's a lot of the arguments I read from YouTube comments that blame class problems on women.,1

@Hippo Bottom Jeans Where? I didn't care that much till you brought it up.,1
If you think that black lives matter means only black lives matter you've shown your own ignorance this movement of black lives matter is a cry out saying black lives matter also... It is sick that a cop would shoot an unarmed or non lethally armed black man. Whites get killed by the cops but 9 times out of ten they were in the wrong the problem is the gross misconduct of excessive jail time and innocent black lives in jail. That's what these people started the black lives matter movement and it's media who have the responsibility to convey the grievances of the people yet you leave us wanting... There are bad protesters and there are bad cops but untill police brotherhood is disbarred and cops work like Walmart employees where they see someone in the wrong they stop it instead of covering it up we're gonna sit here and stew in the wreckage of our ignorance.,1
What a bunch of bull. Lmao do all lives matter or do black lives matter? I can't even believe my ears that that question even had to be put up. Black white Asian middle Eastern East Indian native,1

Zach Jerde no. Not ‘end of discussion’ calling someone an ‘it’ is the most de-humanising thing you could possibly do and that’s disgusting that you think that’s okay. An ‘it’ is what you call an inanimate object or an unidentifiable creature not a human being.,1
You don't get it do you. Black Lives Matter does not mean white lives don't. It just means Black lives are being treated unfairly by the police and this needs to stop. If there's a burning house you would try to save it and not say no but All Houses Matter... Your house isn't burning... Black people needs the BLM movement to get equality. Stop thinking about just yourself and imagine if you're black. You can get killed by just going for a jog,1

@I live in my mom's basement okay,1
Why is it controversial to say 'all lives matter?'   Are you serious!!!!!!!! Did they really have to say Black lives ALSO matter?'  or Black lives matter AS WELL?' in order for you people to know what they were saying? Come on! 'all lives matter?'   is just a smoke screen in order to not address the issue ..Just like bringing up Black on Black crime whenever the subject of Black lives matter is brought up.,1

Same here. I never saw it as something I wouldn't be able to do if I wanted to. And I never thought being female should play a part in that. Who cares if there are fewer women in the engineering fields than men?! I'm here because I wanted to work on engineering projects,0

What i don't understand about most of these comments is that people are saying that girls with short hair are automatically lesbians or the clothes they're wearing. Looks don't Define Who You Are. It doesn't mean if a girl has short hair or if they're clothes not girly enough doesn't mean girls are automatically lesbians!! You can't just put a label on someone and call them something that they are not without knowing their real lives and stories!!,0

It is totally destructive. The poor are being kept poor black or white. It is the poor that has more interaction with the police and are more susceptible abuse by the police.

I want you to know that I watched this video when I was ten years old right when it came out. I have never been more grateful for a video. Since I watched this I have changed my entire trajectory. All of my goals and everything I spend my time on is to become an engineer. I am now a Junior in high school and I have been on a robotics team for 5 years. I spend my time teaching other people about engineering and doing outreach events to inspire young kids to go into STEM. I am in a Pre-Engineering program. I created a STEAM event to teach kids how art and STEM are related. I have done all of this because of this single video. All the time and energy that I have put in I did because of this video. Thank you so much you gave me a passion I didn't know I had and it has changed my entire life. I know you won't see this but I feel in debt to you and I needed to thank you.,0

There are lgbtq persons who do bad things. Thats a given. But that shouldnt be the license to hate everybody else in the lgbtq sphere cause a lot of us are nice and righteous. Generalizing is what needs to go. Ps,0

@Marco Arreola Your words have merit - I'll give them all benefits of doubt - that is what they were going to say. But my statement also has merit - this is what they ended up saying.,1
The problem with saying all lives matter is due to it only being said as a response to black people when they want justice for extra-judicial killings by police. I've never seen the all lives matter crowd when a white person was extra-judicially killed,1

You are ignorant. People don't say white lives don't matter when they say black lives matter. White lives have always mattered and valued more than black lives. To ignore the disproportionate targeting of black people is bizarre. Or maybe you think this society is a happy accident where black people are lesser beings and they made their bed. Saying black lives matter does not mean white lives don't. Saying all lives matter invalidate people that recognize that black people are subjected to racism. If you think black people are subjected to violence the same as whites you are seeing things from a bias that enjoys having power over others.,1
@Jonathan Mason I'm not reading all of that if you can't be bothered to use punctuation. Saying black lives matter does not state or imply that white lives don't matter. If someone stole your car and you went to the police,1

Lilyx Yeah well did you also know black man actually have a better chance of getting their life taken by another black man than a white police officer,1
There has never been a question of all lives matter. The fundamental issue is black lives matter the same. This country has never questioned the value of white lives. It has historically undermined the lives of black and brown lives. The movement is questioning systematic racism and trying to bring the country to a balance state by addressing black lives and making our lives matter as well. There is not a black person that doesn't understand all lives matter,1

I could maybe be sympathetic if they were less vague. All I hear is them ascribing sinister motives to people who seem like they are just being overly friendly nerds.nAnd these testimonials right before the statstics on women engineers in Silicon Valley seem to imply that the reason that there are less women in tech there is because it is a hostile environment for women. But step in your typical engineering classroom in America and then tell me that there are as many women interested in engineering as men. A gender inbalance   does not automatically mean discrimination,0
