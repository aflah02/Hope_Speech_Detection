@Generation X Counting money that she been given for promoting hysterical green agenda.,1
@Paola Hernandez i never said to be intolerant and hateful........ -_-,1

WOW!!!!!!!That was so so inspiring and incredible!!! THis speech has just saved my day,0
@FALC0n  Yea sorry I know Asian is an ethnicity not a race... I'm just trying to generalize🤦‍,1
Blm nooooooonnAsian racism,1
What is making you think they are trying to make black lives matter more. I’m confused,1
I dont agree with homosexualitynFirst of all you are homosexuality,1
@corinthia Long sorry not to fight about this,1
I got called a white saviour for saying reverse racism is wrong. Oh well. 🤷,1
I didn't say he does? Your type seem to be so upset by people saying they are triggered that you would make fun of trigger warnings yourselves,1
It's pretty simple. A large portion of the world is anti-gay and the parades are a way to show that gay people aren't going anywhere and demand the same rights that everyone else has.  It's especially useful for the gay teenagers that are put out onto the street by their christian families and feel like they dont belong anywhere. Being able to see that people like you are celebrating and proud of who they are when everyone around you wants to make you feel ashamed for being gay is something that saves lives.nnHope that answer explains part of it,0
Annie is saying she doesn’t agree with LGBT but you obviously can tell she she is part of the LGBT,1
I hate how that's the thing that people lose their mind about when it comes to Trump! after all the racist and terrible shit he has said it doesn't even matter whether this is anti-Semitic or not.,1
This world needs love,0
@Zach Jerde no it just doesn't matter? Because who actually freaking cares?,1
Why don't all lives matter? Explain to me .-.,1
Repent. God loves the sinner but hates the sin. Don’t believe this creature of Satan. She’s going down and she’ll drag as many as she can with her.,1
I'm a Buddhist...!    ALL LIVES MATTER...!,0
@Skrezo well thats good if gays become illegal in US i would give a party to my whole city.i am from filthy india and live in beautiful UAE,1
One-armed Bandit absolutely spot on. I used to love this ‘women’. Angry I have been deceived. Now I see the man he is. Pushing Trans agenda,1
Epic whip nae nae,2
Ikr she looks like a butch lesbian or something,1
@Tony Mario If you want me to take your argument seriously,1
Im only 11 but I LOVE science and math I want to be a trauma surgeon specializing in nuero surgery. I defintitely think that this will impower young girls like me or younger.,0
Can my dentist stay,1
link butt pls. every time.,1
I didnt see the 'survivor' part and i got mad.,1
Then let's take a look at how important LIFE is for BLM and what BLM is all about. nnA young woman and mother is shot by #BLM terrorists because she said #AllLivesMatter - and the mainstream is silent. nnQuotes,1
Sheriff Clark for president 2024!!,1
@fivedrock It's true isn't it? No matter what I say,1
Send them all back!!!!!!!!,1
its not common for women to work as blue-collar job in construction or plumbing.. Most of 'em are in the professional .,0
Madonna looks stunning. I also love what she said about michael jackson.,1
@BJGvideos This is exactly what I meant.  He never once said that we need to keep kids sheltered and ignorant,1
Madonna is often criticized and looked down on because she is such a strong advocate for undeserved and neglected populations. It’s not only due to her provocative nature. I was waiting for Madonna to say that she is sexually fluid and/or bisexual when asked why she is such an advocate for the LGBT community. I’m not sure if she is or not but always thought she was/is.,0
I say we get rid of all racist tv shows,1
TheLegend27 Is Alive you’ve seen the comments in other threads talking about how she came out right,1
All life matter to China. BLM best for organs,1
@Harris Cobb Because of the immense physical and psychological harm it does to those who are forced to go to such ineffective therapy.,0
Madonna forever. She is so genuine and candid. She is forever evolving.,1
Sunshine littlephilly    hesnnot your you are wrong about god i accept people that believe in it but i do not accept homophobic people they are just an disgrace to the world,1
thank you thats the point,1
typical kid who can't spell,1
I’m conservative and even I know that conversation therapy is horrible. Most conservatives will agree.,0
It's the case for the loud minority,1
Those people are risking their lives,1
@Christina Lavinder More concerned about getting more women in STEM field rather than increasing the male graduation rate... So much for equality.,0
JESUS CHRIST....He is the ONLY answer!!,1
why not everything that lives matter?,1
@coolasice54321 Yea I get it man. I'll be the first to admit that when the black lives matter movement started a few years ago,1
Lock these cattle up!,1
Down with the tyrants of British slavery and brutality lol,1
Black lives matter is racist they wouldnt join up with hispanics if we started Hispanic lives matter and not one time mention them,1
the black guy looses obviously. the black man is guilty regardless of whether or not he initiated it. they're both arrested and charged but the gay dude will get a lighter sentencing.,1
We're in scarrrry times & potentially looking ahead at a possible 4 more years of the same if they don't get it right BUT Madonna remains a beacon of challenge and hope.  Well done lady!,0
@Blake Eloise why can someone not agree with something? She is not hurting anyone with her opinion as long as she is not harassing people.,0
Its a power vacuum like the exact same with Iraq,1
Black lives matter we want to see real change in Justice In our leadership that have the power to make it happen for us black people we are human being just like anyone else . We want equally Justice. In our Justice seyem  Evey were. And stop hate and racem. And stop cops builty. DEFUND POLICE . Stop killing our black people and our kids . Black life's matter,1
I was just sitting here thinking how much I agree with sheriff David Clark,1
No it will not. It will bring more support,1
This is about police brutality it has nothing to do with race,1
All Lives or No LivesnnAnything else is racist. How is it not?,1
@J K Rabbits unlimited.,1
we all heard sweater weather when we saw her,1
Is the person in the maroon a trans guy?,1
Democrats whoring for votes,1
@Maggie Paul Police brutality is not a race related issue. You do know that more white people die in police shootings than black people,1
Hi Jack have fun in ignorance,1
@Dead Sinner Some people are just wishful thinkers... so willing to see the worst,1
All lives can’t matter until Black lives matter,1
All lives matter but this is a black live mater situation black people are being targeted,1
Masterturtle 100 what,1
andrea raimey no one has to repent,1
All lives matter is not politically correct because the Politicians want blacks to be victims.,1
now the nelson Mandela statue  he was a terrorist,1
@Raider and why is that great,1
@Jason Aguirre yes. god even said that in the bible. protecting yourself. you think god is a useless weak pacifist?,1
Why do toys have genders attached to them? What defines a toy as being a girl's toy or a boy's toy? A Barbie is no more a girl's toy than anything perceived by the marketing industry or the indoctrinated majority population of society as being a boy's toy. You are right to say there is nothing wrong with it,1
Abdullah AlMamun nwhat is this comment lol,1
The 'white privilege' schtick is the PC equivalent of the medieval witches ducking stool. nIf the accused woman didn't drown,1
For every black person killed you can name a white person killed by police also. Don’t believe the hype. Liberals want to ruin this country,1
@American Patriot! aw yeah comment more racist tripe,1
For some reason I think this will turn into a war .. . And I don’t want that,1
Watch this right do the bible say ALL LIVES MATTER?,1
Blacks are going too far to protect their rights and trying to end racism and police brutality. Yeah sure Karen,1
Remember when the argument was no ones saying all lives don't matter? And now they're against people saying all lives matter,1
that one girl is DEFINITELY in the closet,1
I don`t want to sound harsh but humans will stay humans and when something is not normal it will trigger some reactions (good or bad). It is really a waste of time to worry about different reactions on your success,1
I’m asexual and lots of people don’t understand that,1
Great interview. This is who and what I think she is really all about,1
@Nibzu of Nibiru loved what,1
Not agreeing with that concept doesn't make you a bad person,1
BiC I Was Just GOnNA SAY THID AHAHAHAH,1
Invinceable nnI blame Fox News for the way you think,1
B. Scott I agree,1
Annie wasnt rude. She formed an opinion and expressed it when prompted to. Also stop assuming every women with a short cut is LGBTQ+,1
ALL LIVES MATTER.    Stop trying to destroy & rewrite our history. The BLM has become nothing more than a breeding ground for racial hatred.,1
playing with barbies and choosing engineering  is totally fine girls!  electrical engineering came naturally to me i wasn't even worried about being less qualified than guys ! in fact my high school teacher encouraged me to go for it and yes he's a man + I come from a muslim third world country and nobody really cared if I was studying engineering or business or art,0
O People! Verily,1
Is deciding for women what they should be interested in a function of egalitarianism or social engineering. The women that are not in Engineering,1
Hannity... you forgot Lyme lives matter,1
Even by taking out a suspicious dude you're trying to save a life,1
The police officer is such a wise man,1
@Leeloo H Hi I believe I am a pleiadian starseed (meaning I incarnated to the pleiadian star system as well as earth) From my understanding a lot of souls do this with different places but don't remember. There are a lot of videos about this and indigos check them out I think you will like it. It's very interesting,1
This video is stupid,1
It's controversial because it goes against the agenda. Especially when it comes to George Soros. Repeat after me..I will be a good,1
Annie gives me a TON of lesbian vibes,1
@Zara Maria Dixon Are you named after the clothing store?,1
All lives matter! God bless America and all lives matter! When you said black lives matter you are selfish and individuals and the issues of life you are asking for. You are just making worst and it will leed to failure results. Please repent and maybe God will hear your petition,1
Ikr.. and something big,1
Dean Smith . Because they don't care about that. They are anti-white racists. That should be becoming obvious.,1
@Unbearable Suffering i guess in this current social climate those will have to be torn down too.,1
+Redblactivist how is Bernie pandering? I don't get it. He's been an activist for black rights as early as the 60s,1
Black Lives Don't Matter any more than Hispanics or Asians or Europeans or Africans or Arabs. Individuals are  responsible for their own words and behavior. There is one race called the human race. So stop race baiting for political agendas!,0
i will never come out as bi to my grandparents because they are very proper and against LGBTQIA+. I came out to my dad and my sister. Im afraid that if i come out to them they will force me to go to conversion therapy,0
Bad Democrats  are very bad very very bad they hurt the people they hurt the people they don’t care about people and it doesn’t nDoes it matter why skin dark skin look at what they doing to the people that live on the streets both parties they act like they don’t exist they act like they don’t exist I got nothing to do with color,0
I’ll never understand when someone says they “don’t agree” with homosexuality. It literally has NOTHING to do with you. There’s nothing to “agree” with. It just is what it is and always has been.,0
It's not about equality. It's about racist black supremacy.,1
Ford Garcia nobody had to agree to anything! How someone chooses to live their life is entirely their choice. It's nobody's place to say I don't accept that because it's not their life to accept. You can have your opinions and beliefs but nobody asked for them especially when it had nothing to do with an individuals life.,1
@Gennifer Bowen In the spectrum of dumb Karens,1
He got boo'ed for saying all lives matter? How are they not racist for that?,1
Annie’s sexuality is really no one’s business. Stop speculating. It’s difficult enough for anyone to accept their sexuality without having people deciding who you are. nnWhatever or whoever she is,1
All lives will matter when blue lives matter,1
All lives matter is controversial wow what a world we live in and the left say they aren’t racist,1
She maybe thinks she is caucasian lol,1
that would just be,1
@B a n e probably with them rolled up pants legs but also the heavily religious family definitely made her say what she said.,1
And I honestly mean that. I get we don't agree with each other AT ALL but I still hope you and your family or friends (who ever you celebrate with) have a brilliant day. And also don't eat too much turkey... I learnt from that mistake last year Lol.,1
I like this police officer. He seems well educated. I will vote for you,1
If you want to walk into a room and do not look like an engineer you have to prove it what does that have to do with being a woman? If I walked in and claimed to be a surgeon no one would believe me either. Most things have nothing to do with sexism...nnMany things would not have been possible without female engineers? Why are we ok with that statement,0
If I hear another white supremacy comment I'm voting Trump,1
I'm one of 2 girls in my Applied Engineering class in highschool. Sometimes I worry that other students or even my teacher might look down on me if I ask questions or need help,1
The real problem no has any  Respect for anything anymore,1
Bigoted sheep.nISIS do the same thing too,1
If you're certain of what you want to study just do it! When i was a kid I thought I would be a superhero,0
Destroying lives seems to be the message coming out of this movement because a lot of PEOPLE are dead or devasted by all this crap.nQuit lying to yourself,1
@Dave Rees lol I'm getting tired of typing. what false info tho? Also the idea that everyone within a decentralized movement is going to be perfect is a falsehood. And that stat is a 50 year prediction. Why does that matter to what I'm talking about? when they say minority they mean in the sense of all other races combined. I don't know why that's all of a sudden so bad.,1
What happened to her GRILLz??,1
I just wanted to say to Christians (I am also one)nGod never said to hate anyone he said to love your “neighbors” no matter what.nJust wanted to mention it,0
What a waste of time. All for nought.,1
Share this if you wanna stop something,1
That picture of George Floyd's daughter makes me cry.,1
They should not be saying black lives matter they should be saying all lives matter,0
She taught me how to be bold and unapologetic...thanks Madge,0
Amen! Unborn babies lives matters!,1
@Calvinist 1689 🤣 Don't be so quick to give Trump so much credit. It's not because of Trump that this is happening. This is an end to systematic operation. For people to argue witch oppressor will oppress you the best is foolish. Republicans and Democrats are guilty of racism.,1
@John Steven Britain and british empire was heavly involved in slavery and Bristol was slave port for a century. Edward Colston and others built Bristol from wealth gained from slavery labor in the Caribbean.,1

@michael bledsoe you know what,1
@Dangus wouzld be great if it was like that but it is an antiö-white movement by now and as such going straight against their declared goals. I can't support that hate group anymore than I could support another hate group.,1
Kenneth Njapa Your point?,1
Ortaiηe Ðeviaη your not alone,1
No.... it’s a race hustling agenda; that’s why it’s hypocritical,1

Can anyone tell me what equipment or software is needed to make videos where you're in one area and the video in another?,1

All lives matter ask God that question,1
@Theodore Haskins You criticize someone for giving an opinion instead of facts.  Then you proceed to go on a rant of your own opinions,1
It's amazing how woke people are these days.,1
All Lives Matter,0
@Baden Jones no you didn't find anything that supports your opinions,1
Just like ISIS and Taliban....destroying history !!,1

@tom - girl Yes you are right. But it seems like the attempt to help them understand is more of an attempt to make the idea seem appealing to them.,1
@SulttaaniSimo Yeah they do...some people just talk that way,1
Question that should be asked is why was the statue still in place. The protesters did Bristol a favour,1
See that's where y'all get it wrong. It's not about the color of our skin,1
@Yvonne Terran white man Divided us to (Berlin Conference of 1864-1865) learn your history,1
Sea Doggo that might be true. But doubt it. I don’t dress as a guy bc I wanna look like a guy or be a guy. Been around the block several times in life and that could be a really naive assumption you are making.,1
I dont agree with homosexuality ..... lol who's she kidding?,1
@anonymous one social distancing bruuuuuh,1
Maggie Paul That is not accurate. BLM has been outed as an organization that does not actually care about black lives. They care about anarchy and funding the democrats. All lives do matter and to suggest otherwise is...wait for it...racist (by definition).,1
Mesmerizing....! Bravo! Why no one came up with this earlier! The way we think the world is developing so fast yet it still manages to surprise us with its absurdity is plain staggering. Although I grew up to be an activist after majoring in social studies,0

Tbh. Though she does fit the lesbian stereotypes which is why people are going crazy about her . I never seen a straight female dress like that. And she feels uncomfortable to the subject which is what I noticed. But then again I’m a femme lesbian like a lisptick lesbian. You would see me as a Barbie  doll.,1
That's crazy... People like these who BEAT people with a bible give Christians a bad rap. Christianity means to love people not be even a little bit like this!!! That guy is so strong for being himself,0
You sound dumb Af,1
I think the way that 'developing an interest in science' is marketed actually almost DROVE ME AWAY from science. No,1
And i thought there are stupid people only in my country.,1
will you tell me how BLM has helped raise the black community? what we need is better education. more of a focus on education. we need to lower the single motherhood rates in the black community. both of those factors have been proven to be linked with crime. i think that when we focus on raising raising our community from WITHIN that is truly the only way we can ever fix issues from the outside,1
There are lgbtq persons who do bad things. Thats a given. But that shouldnt be the license to hate everybody else in the lgbtq sphere cause a lot of us are nice and righteous. Generalizing is what needs to go. Ps,0

Snorres Edda You're a fucking idiot. Tell me when BLM supporters went around LYNCHING people FOR THE SKIN COLOR THEY WERE BORN WITH.

Why are people suddenly saying All Lives Matter? Is it in response to Black Lives Matter? Are the All Lives Matter people offended by Black Lives Matter? It certainly appears to be the case. When I see Black Lives Matter I am not offended. I don't interpret it as Black Lives Matter More Than Other Lives. Perhaps they should of called themselves Black Lives Matter Too so that the All Lives Matter snowflakes didn't get offended. Who in their right mind would interpret Black Lives Matter as something negative and racist? Perhaps right minded Proud Conservatives.,1

ALL INNOCENT LIVES MATTER,1
So anyone seen that video of the Dallas cop kneeling on that white dude’s neck? The guy died from a heart attack apparently during the incident.  He was high on drugs. The cops were charged. That scenario familiar to anyone else? Well the guy was white so we weren’t shoveled that story because it didn’t fit a narrative.,1
That's not what black lives matters mean. Black lives matter is a movement to protest against police brutality. And all lives matter was a movement to figt against the black lives matter movement.,1

@0 0 nNobody is celebrating a slave trader are they? It's history,1
No matter the reasons people have to rebel against a goverment unneccesary violence like looting and defacing statues is more mob mentality. The reason we have invented modern democracy (flawed as it is) is so people could solve disputes with discussion and peacefull assembly. A society where  everyone would have the right to assembly  free speech and  protection t from discrimination would come together vote on people to run the country and set rules (that did not violate the members rights) that governed the country. People who violated these rules or supected to would have a chance to prove they did not do it. Such a society requires peacefull discussion of the matters at hand. In such a society there is no need for rioting,1

Bruh that’s different there’s some brutality that black ppl go through just that we don’t know about it silly,1
As Long as we keep calling ourselves black we see systematic racism end. Black and White true meaning under law is (status). It does not mean race. We should not identify with a color. We must evolve and comprehend no one can be the color black or white!! We are not African American if that were true we would have dual citizenship. Think.. Malcom x said we are (Aboriginals). ..They are playing us on both sides... for entertainment. Martin Luther King said we were here before they were here on the this land. Awake from the deception !!,1
Palestinian lives matter too,1

@Joe Smith yeah its more about equality and giving people equal treatment this black lives matter is just going to favor a race and cause more racism some black people who are liberals are more racist than white people. Some black people are starting to blame white people for riots and looting just because they are white people. People just want the black vote and mention race to anything happening to a black person.,1
They already did in 1820,1

@hanz patinski LOL!!! I'm not ashamed of what others do. It is the human condition and isn't isolated to any one race of people. My prayer is God save me from being angry at others that I don't agree with. How can I be of service to others. I'm grateful for the things I'm not grateful for. It is where I find the grace of God.

Conversion therapy should be illegal! It is totally a violation of people’s rights and it is physical and mental abuse!,0
That one young woman is not necessarily in the closet. I know many of the viewers on this are quite young and judgemental in a sense. I was also raised in a household with strong beliefs. I think it’s very incredible that she expressed hers and came on this show. It also shows that her parents are willing to accept her no matter what. She’s an absolutely beautiful and such an intelligent girl and I truly hope she reads more positive comments. Many of the people commenting are very young,0
People who sold black people into slavery want to rescue them from the legacy of slavery. Anyway,1
Omg im crying rn BLACK LIVES MATTER and be safe from corona too ofc!,1
I’m so tired I thought that conversion therapy said conversation therapy and I was so confused like why do you have to survive conversation therapy,1

How about human lives matter. ITS THE ONLY RACE THERE IS!!!!,1
The atheist ovah here would like to join the beating idiots with a book party.,1
All lives matter is basically supporting black lives matter if you think about it .,0
Cop pulled me over came to the window and asked for my licence and insurance and to search my car all in the same sentence. I told him he could search it then asked what i did wrong he said what you going to tell me you dont smoke weed. When another officer pulled up and asked why hes searching my car he said he thought it might be stolen after running my information already. If it wasnt for that other cop i would have gone to jail for being black.the cop wasnt following me i drove past him he saw my face and did a u turn in the middle of the street. I left the situation without a ticket.  Hell yeah some are racists.,1
all lives matter only exists as a counterprotest to a protest against racism,1
Yeah! Well there are lives that don’t matter. The lives that are hidden in a blueprint that only God knows about. But then when their presence becomes obvious then the argument comes in that     there’s a choice to be made. How valuable is that life? Sadly many times not at all.,1
Bob Lazar blm. They are disproportionately killed,1
4 years later and we still arguing,1
They gonna replace the statue with a JEREMY CORBYN  one,1
If you actually think All Lives Matter,1
If anyone really like thinks this is okay for a child to go through and they're throwing all this s*** out there in front of their face oh my God this is very troubling,1

@Sλlty dude read the comment its not just US nIts about humanity,1
@alison barker  so you could say that you also assume the statistically small number of drug use its okey too... even drug use has many negative effects... No man,1
there is but it isn't inherently to one race. cop's should be held account for accidental deaths or murders/ abuse of force when authorized. the fact you labeled white folks lmfaoo yea you'r not prejudice though right?,1
+John Smith why don't we just agree to all life matters no matter what the color is human life is precious and We Are All Sons & Daughters of God no matter what our color,1
Juan Williams is right.nYou can get upset with the Democratic Party for pandering to black people,1

Black lives matter is not discrediting other races it is just saying that we as black people are mistreated by society so they are saying we mean something we MATTER,0

we should have never taken blacks out of Africa hundreds of years ago. We would never have had this problem,1
I already imagined that to be the case.nI guess the organizers didn't feel like starting a riot with those idiots,1
And is this a peaceful protest????????,1
Was I the only one who thought this was about the tv show?,1
Juan needs to wake up. We are a country as a whole,1
hahaha a dude saved you life.....oh how sick is humaity....???,1
She is allowed to have a different opinion. If she is being respectful of others theres no harm,1

This slave trader tortured people to death!!!,1
This is all so sick. God is about love and he calls Christians to love everyone despite their sins,0
You don't get it do you. Black Lives Matter does not mean white lives don't. It just means Black lives are being treated unfairly by the police and this needs to stop. If there's a burning house you would try to save it and not say no but All Houses Matter... Your house isn't burning... Black people needs the BLM movement to get equality. Stop thinking about just yourself and imagine if you're black. You can get killed by just going for a jog,1
Deadpool is pansexual and this comment is giving me Deadpool vibes,1
I am a Catholic and the thought of conversion therapy on anybody disgusts me. I know that the Jesus I serve is NOT the same one that this person unfortunately had to experience. God is love and the way he was treated was NOT love so NOT God. I like what that little boy said. God is love and I chose to love. --Paige Kohlman nnnAmen,0
@BluPanda Maybe it's just her REAL opinion and you don't seem to accept it?,1
I Don't Agree With Homosexuality. nnThe Haircut,1
I am also Christian,1
@Molly Rebekah since you're all about your new testament what did Jesus say about homosexuality?,1
Because all life matter include white and cops  these are two thing BLM hate,1
I stopped watching when I saw Sandra Bland's name given as if she was killed by racism. She committed suicide after being detained for a day for acting like a hysterical crazy person. The police do the same to anyone. Freak out on a cop and you'll spend a night in a jail cell to cool down. Turned out she was crazy enough to kill herself as soon as she could.nnStop black supremacy. Stop hating white people. The US government should treat all citizens the same regardless of race. We don't need a racial apartheid state or caste system or second-class citizens. No race is subhuman. Criminals,0
Wow that's a new one.,1
I’m really confused why blm is a thing in America considering if you look at the stats more white people get killed by blacks then blacks by whites. Why are people not talking about that ?,1
@_ JDP2104 _ The word of God proves JESUS CHRIST is LORD,1
Butt of the day!!,1
@t0bias busterud Yes exactly.,1
the black lives matter movement isnt made to say only black lives matter. #blacklivesmatter is to express the importance of black lives that aren't acknowledged. saying all lives matter is belittling the focus of black lives matter. of course every life matters,1
Much love and respect for Madonna!!!,1
Realise that some people in that airport who died were Europeans / Americans,1

Zeus is better than Jesus,1
black lives matter this is what the media dosen't show you,1
I think that being a woman has less to do with being interested and capable of being anything traditionally where men excel at. I think personality type differences are a bigger factor in determining that. Institutionalized and gender barriers aside,0
buy a dictionary and look up All then look up racism,1
who remembers that one episode of the boondocks where Martin Luthor King jr. comes back to life and see's what the black community has become and ends up hating blacks,1
The irony is these statues represent life back then and how we have moved on.....problems with racism will still exist with or without statues....try addressing the real problems rather than going for harmless lumps of copper and stone,1
If someone yelled out only white lives matter,1
They really mean to say ONLY Black Lives Matter,1
@CLIP IT! woah woah woahhhhh chill. I'm bisexual and I'm very much NOT a piece of crap,1
I agree with Black Billy Joel too!nnSERIOUSLY,1
She's the queen and looks it to love u,1
All lives matter. What about all the minority businesses that was destroyed over something that happened in Minneapolis. Im a minority and all lives matter to me. The hell with the Democrats they dont care about us! They are using us!,1
She definitely matters. She and other immigrants are what make America great,1
So where did the woman say she was applying to a job? The only reason someone would question your capability at a job interview based on your looks would be when you are expected to wear office clothes and you go in a shirt,1
Oh my God yasss!! I'm muslim,1
@*****nYou can virtue signal all you want but you know that isn't what I meant. I was talking about open and outright rejection of something,1
why is everyone so dumb,1
@John Karn do what u want. but dont act like idiots just cos one black guy got killed i mean if he was white nobody would care.,1
@Srbin Srbin I guess people across the world should go somewhere else because they don't like being mistreated 🤔. You're obviously the Dummy and will see who will go where.,1
Big Lies Matter... Why didn't the protestors show any mercy for those black officers who lost their lives in the streets during this madness? Because black lives mater only when they can use it to achieve their political goals.,1
I have said over and over that it is o.k.to love both genders. It's having a sexual relationship with the same gender that is a sin. You don't go to hell for loving the same gender,1
Not trying to personally attack you,1
Did your dentist beat you,1
another push to divide everyone just like the pushing of anti-Semitism in the UK's political arena. Voting is pointless as it's likely leaders are selected not elected. All governments are puppets of the controllers who then control you via television to program your minds. The TV is their remote control of YOU!!,1
FOX NEWS Political Annalist Hack Juan Williams!,1
@Troy White By the way you forget that it was the republicans who abolished slavery. Under Trump's presidency the black community has benefited a great deal,1
if all lives matter then blm shouldn’t effect you,1
Dude has a serious ped0 vibe.,1
Thank u! I’ve read so many bullshit comments on this video,1
Hailstorm if that is the only thing you’d like to take from it then you’re more than welcome to. It’s unfortunate that you’d draw such a defined line in the sand but that’s your prerogative to do so. I’d like to know is violence the only thing you see from the movement? Would you agree that there are some BLM protest that are peaceful from start to finish?,1
i would like this video a thousand times if i could,1
All Lives Matter. Communities that have failing schools,0
Does anyone else find it weird that the brain named itself ?,1
@HooverDude 60 What kind of argument is that for anything. WTF? Seriously. Be honest. I am lost on the agreesion. Why the attack on the subject. What is so threatening. The statue lords up a wrong doer to put it politely. Bad deeds are not discounted by other bad deeds because they are in say your percieved opinion,1
I've been a fan since the 80s and can't understand what you're taking about. How is she not recognizable? She certainly is to me and looking amazing by the way.,1
sad lxlita no sorry bby there are like 72,1

This looks pretty scary now at 2020,1
@Five gold star England paid over 40% of its nations money to buy the freedom of every single slave in the Empire. No one was left behind. Even the Queen hated it,1
I understand why this would be,1
@Vinnie McBride no. Just ones like Churchill and Cromwell are ones I'm really after because it's a wonder one of them has a statue at all and the other has had his history covered up for an awful long time now.,1
Or go join it in the museum with ur antique thoughts lol,1
@Ashley Laurencya The only truth here is that conversion therapy does not work in ANY country (I'm not American either). Sorry to disappoint you. Sexual identity and preferences are rooted deep into our genetics,0
PPL WHO THINK THEY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DO THIS,1
all lives dont matter until black lives matter-sure i get your point but NO ONE should get attacked for being racist when saying all lives matter. people gotta use logic,1
Thank You Madonna … thank you so much.,1
It's controversial to say all lives matter because it goes against the Democratic party's plantation management scheme for black people.,1
Congrats sweetheart!!!nI had no idea until I was twelve,1

Can we all agree all human lives are equal,1
@Amazing Worenwu I'm glad someone agrees,1
Vlad Burlacu Really! So does black lives matter?,1
it should be because we're allowed to have on religion but not act on it if what were doing is illegal i. this case harming someone's physically,0
link for the picture? no? ok cool,1
of course al lives matter. the point of the phrase is that black lives are being treated as expendables by the police and the government that employs them. black lives need our focus right now because the situation has gotten out of control.,1
Jessica Walker that passage was mistranslated...,1
@Steve 30x it is still 2020. I agree nobody should be a legal property of another mane. Slaves were a form of cash at time. Today there is more slavery than ever in a different shape and form. one of them is the low cost market. we think it was design around the poor man in reality is exploiting us. I don't see these statues as a celebration or invitation to slavery. Queens of England knighted pirates back in centuries. Was is it right? Nooo. But it is the past. it is something we are to learn from. symbols are symbols,1
Most women are taking engineer courses because they are so insecure they need mommy and daddy to pick their destiny for them.,1
@Dave Ross nno he was saying that people get mad about conversion therapy (which I do think Is messed up) while no one cares that millions of innocent children are murdered everyday,1
@Theodore Haskins dude,1
This is disguising,1
@Elie 192 And there was no times of Noah FYI.. the Biblical flood myth is a direct plagiarization of the earlier Sumerian flood story.  As for homosexuality being a demon,1
This is very similar to me but I`m only 15. My math teacher handed me a Lego robotics kit and told me to build something and he walked away with the instructions. I did build a really cool crane that was drive-able and you could move it up and down and move objects with it,1
@Fish Keeper Because you are LITERALLY dismissing a group of people who need help right now. Plus,1

P.S. that’s not to say I agree with the original comment by the way. It sounds wrong for some reason I’m unable to pin-point.,1
BLM protest are becoming a problem in some parts of the world. In Japan,1
A d now he wany to personally tbank him,1
For all the people saying that  all lives matter we're not saying that your lives don't matter we're just saying black lives matter because apparently some of the policemen don't get that and are killing innocent black people for example you go into a bladder cancer convention and just scream out all cancer matters but they say that we know that all cancer matters of stuff that were raising awareness to this particular cancer but then you just keep on yelling all cancer matters that's how stupid you sound,1
@CRYxBABY absolutely!!! We need to stop making it about race.,1

They will say anything to win I say all lives matter and am black,0
@Timothy KimmelnI think you're confused. Trump is actually Hitler's son and he's going to round up all of the gays and muslims and non-whites and flay them alive while submerging them into lava pits. I heard that on MSNBC. Can't find the link but Trump definitely said it. I have to admit,1

how about picking the right person for the job fuck fucks sake.  if you're good at what you do then fucking own it. if you act like you don't deserve to be there people will sense that and it will detract from every decision you make.nnpeople ask if you're the engineer because their exposure to the industry shows that its statistically unlikely that you are. people make small social assumptions every day its how we fuckign function as a society. if you see someone in a store wearing a black collared shirt and black pants you are inclined to think they work there. if people didn't make small social assumptions based on previous experience we'd all be wondering around getting nothing done too scared to say anything because we aren't sure of someones entire life story. FUCKING STOP OVER ANALYSING SHITnni bet all those guys who ask if you're the software engineer never ask you that question more than once. after that,1

People always assume I'm not technical. I don't assume anyone is technical unless I know them...? So? And why would someone being happy that you're en engineer be negative? The stats show that 12% of engineers in the US are women. So they are being supportive,0

Just take a look and listen to what black music artist and their videos are depicting and the culture that they are promoting and you will see why there is so much unemployment and poverty its what people aspire to and who they look up to that influences the way they choose to live... not all black people aspire to this culture and live a normal and good life.,1
xBrownskinAngelx So why are more white lives being killed by the police? Do you really think white lives being killed is justified and black lives killed by police is solely because of racist cops? No data supporting that theory. Yet no one was protesting when a white man was killed the exact same way George Floyd died. This is a race war perpetuated by White Supremacists to fool Black people into thinking they are and forever will be oppressed. No honey,1
Excuse me but I don't understand .....if your born in America are you not just an American what does the colour of your skin have to do with it...???,1

@Mr Irish yeah it should be like that but if u said all lives matter that would be said to be racist. People would think ur trying to take something away from them turning it to all lives matter. My dad saw a poster the other day and it said in the last five years police have killed 1262 black people and 2412 white people. So there's been double the amount of white people killed by police but it doesn't make the news. Ur right. All lives matter. Its not about colour it's about police brutality,1

Anja I was just wondering why you think 18 is too young. 12-13 is the average age that’s puberty starts and so that when you typically start to develop sexual feeling towards people.

More unarmed white men are killed by cops every year than black ones. We never see their faces. We never hear their names. Is it because white lives don't matter? Is it no big deal for an unarmed white man to die at the hands of the police? We have so many of them after all. Surely there is a surplus. How,1

So choose carefully whether it's computer engg. Or mechanical engineering.,0
I am pursuing Chemical Engineering and I have these 'give up' kind of thoughts all the time. I went for an internship and the senior engineer there told me that these companies don't take in girls for their field work and that's why you may not see many (or any at all) female chemical engineers in companies. They didn't even have a female washroom in their main building where they worked,1

They will always wanted to get right.. and if I try to speak my mind in a strong way like they did then suddenly I'm not a gentleman anynmore.. I totally understand what these women are suffering but trust me if it was the other way around it would be worst...,1

Some of you are toxic as hell. You said she’s this and she’s that even though the whole time she was being really respectful? Then you all go and disrespect her just because she doesn’t accept you. She isn’t causing any harm. Catch a fucking grip and I’m saying this a supporter of the LGBT community,1

The thing that I don't understand is why is there even a need to say that all lives matter? And what's ironic is the ones who preaches that saying support capital punishment. This is not an argument for CP but just pointing out the fact that in many cases,1
Do the lives of undocumented immigrants matter?  Do the lives of the homeless matter?  What about the people not serving in the military but are being killed by military weapons (I mean hunting rifles),1

All lives matter.  It's not healthy to divide and conquer on racial lines.  That's why I am worried about the black lives matter movement.nI stand for every child - no matter what the colour.

Stubsy13 I agree but do you not see that mainly people of color are being affected be police brutality. And as much I want to put skin color aside I can’t. The fact of the matter is that a black person is not white and white person is not black. If you don’t see that police brutality happens  towards colored people more than white people then come out under the rock you live in. Not acknowledging white privileged is racist. I know your attentions are good much love brother.,1

Where did you get that God doesn't want them to live? He wants them to change. He wants everyone to live and change their sinful ways. You're a very angry and bitter person. He hates no one He hates sin. How do you not get that?,1

BLM is a racist organisation - provide evidence for systematic invisible racism or this needs to be deemed terrorist - implying people need to know BLM is a slap in the face and a step backwards - want to fix racism stop talking about it,1
Must be hard for them,1
Its not really controverisal. Union Jack & THE British empire has sentenced more black lifes to capital punishment than vice versa. The hypocrisy when Great Britain makes moral judgement towards THE confederate flag & American South just becomes pathetic & a political suicide.,1

Strange how every 4 years the race topic seems to rise to the top of the news. Most people agree that there is definitely a problem,1
All lives do matter and there is also a  problem with police brutality.  What is that sherriff talking about?  He is only disagreeing about police brutality cause he is a police officer.,1

Why don't more girls go into Engineering?  Because they make the choice not to pursue that type of career. It's as simple as that.  And honestly,1
I don’t understand why they say BlackLivesMatter All LivesMatter don’t they,1
maybe it's a confidence thing,1
i always find her to be condescending and kind of rude in interviews,1
That Sheriff is probably one of the most impressive men I've ever seen. What a role mode!. Sadly a lot of people in black communities don't see men like him as a good role model. Not all but definitely some.,1
@Baden Jones it's not a choice,1
There racist so let's start a saying black lifes matter but if they say all life's matter fuck no fuck white people those racist people,1
+RandomHelpingGuy The same could be said for women in engineering but there was national will to overcome that.  I expect the same national will to overcome the prejudice you are talking about.,0

Alfredo Ramirez but it does exist so your point is invalid white people are not being targeted all lives matter is a protest to the black lives matter because at the end of the day If Black lives don’t matter neither would white lives why did they just start saying all lives matter when black lives matter protest can’t up,1

My thoughts are if women want to do engineering they should go in it. And they should know that nobody is stopping them. That's important. Don't teach girls there's some patriarchy oppressing them,0

Black Lives Matter is out there to be researched. They are a far left globalist organization that has received over $100 million in donations from liberal organizations.  To include George Soros’ Open Society Foundation.nnThey are not a group about black lives that matter,1
Sometimes interviewers are so annoying,1

Good interviewer for a change.. substance & depth. Lovely interview. xx,1

We should let all these new young librals look at this and see,1
BigDaddyEddy show me where I mentioned Antifa or riots? You’ve turned to insults because you haven’t got a response to the points I made. Ironically the only snowflake in this discussion has been you so far. nIf you bothered to read what I said before then you’ll see me state clearly multiple times that I’m against all forms of racism. nYou’re so f**king dumb that not only are you arguing against someone who’s fighting for the same cause as you but you’re bringing up my skin colour as an insult while trying to stop racism. Hypocrisy at its finest,1

Alysa Rice This comment thread is so wholesome 🥺,1
All I have to say is they all missed the point,1
The same party that keeps insisting you don't need guns; the police will protect you also hate the police and want to defund the police while taking everybody's guns away.  You'd think they're working for Stalin or something. Demonrats don't have a prayer.,1
Sure dummy if you can’t see that black people are being used every 4 years by the left then you have serious issues,1

God gave us a choice. My choice is to love. I'm crying,0

Why don't they follow social distancing rules?,1
Our God is about loving others. Conversion therapy and that sort of abuse does NOT fall in line with what he teaches us. It appalls me that some people call themselves Christians and think that's okay.,0

@jazzfan1 Fox (Right) & CNN (Left) are two different sides of the same coin. And if we just start throwing insults we've already lost the battle cause no one will listen to each other. Yes,0
The left lost brexit the left lost with trump winning so why not go with chaos and destruction. They control the education system and media and now after years of brainwashing the youth that white supremacy is all around them they now release those young fearful mind onto the streets.,1

I'm gonna unsubscribe now from this leftist propaganda. I thought this was just about culture and nature and shit like that but nope they support a terrorist organization. An organization that is calling for use of chemical warfare aka mustard gas on American citizens. Great work,1
Actually black and white are classed as pigments not colours. Just thought I would correct you on that.,1
Trump probably doesn't even run his own social media pages. Most politicians don't.,1
By saying black lives matter you're not saying others don't. You're just saying,1

Sitting with people and talking about important topics of society is child abuse to you? Sorry to break it to you but school does exactly the same.nAlso their parents are like right behind the camera,0
Couldn't agree with you more. Raising kids on a safety net is only jacking up our taxes more. The only exception I would make is if you had the kids before welfare. If it was discovered you were having kids,1
@jazzfan1 you should educate yourself self with facts and have your own mind and then you will see the truth. Don't be a sheep.,1

Never liked playing with Barbies or dress up really tbh. It was something I scarcely remember trying once or twice. All the dolls I got for my birthdays were never opened from their boxes. That or they collected dust in my closet. I always found myself playing with my brother's legos and my animal toys. Or playing outside with my dinosaur figures and collecting rocks and plants. My dad got me a Bob the Builder tool box set and I loved that thing. As I did with the show. I remember seeing those TV ads selling plastic builder/workshop tool sets for boys and always wanting one myself. I would've loved Goldie Blocks if it was around when I was a kid. nnThis video was very inspirational. Intelligent and beautiful woman. Glad she never gave up. Im starting to get into engineering myself,0
so stupid this whole thing ahaha,1
I think all the pride parade has to do is to get a different organizer one that did not sign their list of demands and they'll be good. unless there's some sort of legal issue I'm not aware of.,1

They brainwashed you. You can't change who you are.,1
very interesting to see the point of view from their prospective,1
@JD1710a It Does bother me,1
she has mocked the gays.....you will learn,1
“Black lives matter” is a racist slogan. Nobody can single out any race and put it against others like that without being called racist.,1
Like said they did some dumb ass shit,1
Well she was fighting for us in the mainstream media when no one was,0

TheLegend27 Is Alive yeh I guess so but it’s just a stereotypical example and most lesbians go for that kind of style so that’s what I think,1
White lives matter! Now does anyone think that's racist???,1
Why do you think people that aren’t black aren’t worth anything?,1
@Arcane Flame Maybe if they got their heads from out their asses they might see something other than their own Sh**. If by now they dont know what black ppl talking about its because they choose not to know..,1

Randall Sims No one is arguing that! So does Black Lives Matter?,1
A Friendly Gemini I’m sorry if you don’t understand but let me just explain. Saying all lives matter is taking away from what the problem is. Here’s an example. Let’s say there is five kids one kid falls and hurts his leg and wants a bandaids. He gets one. Why give the other kids bandaids if they don’t need it. We are saying WE GETTING KILLED. We’re saying we’re that kid that fell and hurt his leg. We are saying it takes away from us. So I hoped this help you understand why we feel that saying all lives matter is disrespectful.,1
@Molly Cone uh,1
@Lumen I'm sorry for any bad experiences you may have had with people professing to be Christians. Sometimes people say they are but don't represent Jesus's teachings very well.nnAnyway,1

@rgw1380rw maybe I'll hire some.,1
Hats off to Sheriff David Clarke! It is the Democrats who have enslaved the black community with a benefits cheque so effectively buying their votes with public money. Social security was designed to be a safety net not a hammock that has become a lifestyle as this clear thinking Sheriff points out.,1
Just a friendly reminder that ALL LIVES MATTER,1

@Billy Kersh HE WOULD  TAKE 10 EXTRAS AND A GUN,1
Cats999 u might not think it but it does discredit it and also the only reason yall have a problem is it is because it’s meant for black ppl and that the blm movement is the biggest movement for impowring a race out. black ppl who were forced to come to america and then left with no rights now we gettin killed or racially discriminated cause our skin so b4 u say sum black lives matter was and is meant to impower black lives and at its early stages it was only black ppl and other skin colors used it to one another. ur actin like there arent movements for other races between their community,1
There's a comment just like this above this..,1
demon....her teeth are horrible,1
I dont agree with the lgbtq community. But I will say out of the deepest respect that everyone no matter what gender and sexual oriantation should be treated with love and kindness and the same. And I believe we should pray for people. Not shove what your oppinion is down someones throat to change there minds. It doesnt work that way. We cant change people,1
Couldnt agree more all lives matter but as a white person we only allowed to say blm if not we are rasist in fact the very statement of only saying blm is racist we should be united and say alm,1
Everyone is bullying the girl who didint agree with him,1

@Fate Kyougo Yes! I felt bad growing up because I didn't have a passion in the way it is marketed. It doesn't help the kids who have that marketed passion anyways- they think they're interested in quantum mechanics,1
The oppressed will become the oppressor and then white lives will matter. Equilibrium is only achieved for brief moments before things fall the other way,1

@Aziyah Charles its a sentence,1
Black lives matter is just another racist organization where it all is about race and the color of your skin and blaming all other non black people. There is not any difference between this organization and KKK.,1
Randy Snyder Randy Snyder I will point it out.  An African or “other” sounding name read on a resume is less likely to get an interview (and people shouldn’t have to change their names to appease white culture - especially knowing America gained its foundational wealth on the backs of slaves),1
I live in Europe and I can't stop crying about this. Every news is shocking to me. I wish love to all fighting for the truth and I hope that we all manage to get along with each other one day.,1
I agree fully! it bothers me when a little boy can't even hold a doll because that's a toy for girls!. play with toy guns instead!. I don't think toys have any gender,0

@Tyrone Marcus hahaha,1
How about ‘Innocent Lives Matter’?,1
Okay everyone’s so focused on her wording of She doesn’t agree with it but to me when you listen to everything else she says after that it sounds like she’s saying that she doesn’t see herself as being about to be homosexual but that she doesn’t mind that other people are homosexual and that she’ll love and respect them regardless,0
And we will tear down Mandela statues,1
edgy music and memes,1
@Roy Blevins ok good. White lives matter,1
99% is a huge number mate,1
I'm sorry but I can't respect a person who think homosexuality is wrong. I just can't.,0
@PepeThePoopyPants That's OK,1
And you know that for a fact ?,1
Wait the girl that does not believe in homosexuality is straight????nThis is my take on life... if you’re not hurting yourself or others,1

why didn't they just name it 'life matters? its not like asians are getting respected either,1
PATTYY L of course you can but it makes you ignorant and closed minded ^^,1
According to Obama Hilary and sanders their lives matter because their guards can carry around guns but normal citizens aren't allowed to defend themselves. Do not vote democrat. Vote for trump he won't take part in this race baiting and siding with thugs,1

Ironically nearly all the protesters are young and have had the most liberal life and upbringing on the planet  A few days work may change their attirude.,1
should have taken it to the scrap yard gotta be 500kg of bronze.,1
Major Tom nnI’m not sure I would ever be able to “make peace” with such people even if I did take a pill that changed some aspect of my personality for their sake. There’s something fundamentally flawed about those people that runs deeper than just this one opinion about one thing. It’s likely the same logic they use to find homosexuality problematic is also running in the background of other judgements they make. It seems to me like the best solution is to bring them to some kind of change or new understanding of the world rather than changing a more superficial feature of other people to appease them. I think that actually moves everyone in the right direction.,1
Because she is often vulgar,1
I thought this was going to say therapist not therapy survivor and I cringed so much,1
@Molly Cone  molly....where is your proof? 🤣🤣🤣🤣,1
Like right now but people  dont understand that because we dont know where the present begins because its measured by a hairline thin line on a clock and we hold hate towards painful pasts,1
@Ed Jessup Yes,1
He died by a police brutality( Even tho he shouldn't) and people accused the case is the case of racism because the police is white,1
They are aleady preaching this at gunpoint right now. They want a black communist country....and thats what this has been about from the very beginning. What do you think BLM is doing with all the money donated to them? Giving it to poor black children for a better education. They  don't give a fuck about shit...they don't care who dies for their cause,1
They tossed it in the harbor where it belongs,1
oilcube bottle Ik just don’t say All lives matter,1
Bbm add#11 ok 1. that came out of nowhere and 2. babies aren’t the same thing as fetuses,1
@brandonshmandon Pretty sure a lot of it was also due to lockdown protests in the US. Most of the BLM protests are done with a mask one although not everyone keeps distance,1
Jessica S Wish You all the best !!! Talent is grown,1
@Skechy Yeti if someone is subjected to that level of mental and physical amd trauma than the term survivor is warrented. if its applicable to other things as well that shouldnt affect it. people have died as a result of conversion therapy and those who have survived it often deal with ptsd which is very difficult to live with,1
people who are looting are using BLM as a reason to lot. they are opportunists. BLM protests started off as peaceful but police started to teargas and brutalized peaceful protesters.,1
I didn't come out of the closet. My mum walked in by accident,1

@Jessica Walker That's not true at all. The East is more anti-LGBT than the West and this has nothing to do with any religious doctrine,1
NOXISUM How? The whole statement was created to support people of color saying that all lives matter and we shouldn’t be killing people on their race I understand that black lives are definitely more in need but I don’t understand what’s wrong with the phrase.,1
@Beast Slasher you're just so hateful.,1

Oh I get it you're talkin about Black  Americans why do people call them African Americans  none of them ever even been to  Africa probably,1
The only historic thing about this is the complete lack of police brave enough to do their job. The demonstrators are nothing more than vandals,1
It's a trap,1

I agree that all lives matter although I care about no one else's life except for my family's and friends. Those are the only lifes that matter to me.,1
This happens every 4 years because of the dumfuk Democrats,1
OK the title black lives matter is like an analogy or maybe  a metaphorrnwhen black individuals are being killed for no reason except for the color of their skin its almost as if their lives ' . people who are pressed about it not saying all lives matter are too focused on the title of the movement instead of what it's  for. and i don't think this movement is racist because it would be saying only black lives matter...ni hope other minorities with gain the traction to fight injustices they are facing as well #blm,0
